# Pandas DataFrames  

## General  
- Pandas is built on top of Numpy and Matplotlib.  
- Better than Numpy array as DataFrames can contain multiple data types.  
- You can think of DataFrame columns as single-dimension arrays called Series.
-	We can convert a dictionary to a dataframe   
    
### Creating a data frame  
- Noted: missing data is indicated by NaN (Not-a-Number)  

**1. First create a list/s**  
years = [2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020]  
durations = [103,101,99,100,100,95,95,96,93,90]  

**2. Then create a dictionary of those lists**  
movie_dict = {'years':years,'durations':durations}  

**3. Then convert that dictionary to a DataFrame**  
durations_df = pd.DataFrame(movie_dict)  

**Import and read a csv file into a DataFrame**  

    import pandas as pd  
    brics = pd.read_csv(“brics.csv”, index_col = 0)  
    index_col = 0 shifts the DataFrame a column left  

**Select column with type DataFrame**  

brics[[‘country’]]  
brics.loc[ :, [‘country’, ‘capital’]] - selects the country and capital columns
brice.loc[ :, ‘country’: ‘capital’] - selects columns from country to capital
brics.iloc[ :, [0,1]]

Row access (and all columns):
brics[1:4] - can only get row access through slicing if you don’t use loc
brics.loc[[‘RU’, ‘IN’, ‘CH’]]
brics.iloc[[1]]
brics.iloc[[1,2,3]]

Row and column access:
brics.loc[[‘RU’, ‘IN’, ‘CH’], [‘country’, ‘capital’]]
brics.iloc[[1,2,3], [0,1]]

loc - label based
iloc - integer based location

- To change the index numbers in the far left column:  

    brics = [‘BR’, ‘CH’, ‘DU’]

Filtering Pandas DataFrames

brics[brics[“area”] > 8] - first checks the column “area” for values that exceed 8 and then outputs all the rows where that condition is met

brics[np.logical_and(brics[“area”] > 8, brics[“area”] < 10)] - searches the “area” column for values exceeding 8 and less than 10 and outputs the rows in the DataFrame which meet these conditions

Calling the .iterrows() method when iterating over a Pandas DataFrame:
Used to iterate over a pandas Data frame rows in the form of (index, series) pair. This function iterates over the data frame column, it will return a tuple with the column name and content in the form of a series.   

for lab, row in brics.iterrows():
	print(lab +  “: “ + row[“capital”])

On each iteration this for loop generates two pieces of data: the ‘label’ in the row and then the actual data in the row as a series.

row is a bit of a misnomer as it refers to the row data in the specified column name.

Pandas
.head() - prints first 5 rows of a DataFrame
.tail() - prints last 5 rows of a DataFrame
.info() - displays info about the data such as type and non-null items
.dtypes - returns the data types in the DataFrame
.shape - this attribute displays the number of rows and columns in a DataFrame
.describe() - computes summary stats for columns with numeric values
.values - prints the data in the DataFrame
.columns - prints column names
.index - prints the number of rows

Sorting and subsetting DataFrames

.sort_values(“weight_kg”) - sorts the column “weight-kg” in ascending order
.sort_values(“weight_kg”, ascending = False) - sorts by descending order
.sort_values([“weight_kg”, “height_cm”], ascending = [True, False]) - sorts “weight_kg” by ascending order and then sorts “height_cm” by descending order


dogs[[“breed”, “height_cm”]] - inner brackets create a list of column names to subset and outer brackets subset the DataFrame
dogs[dogs[“date_of_birth”] > “2015 - 10 - 25”] - outputs all rows in the DataFrame which have a “date_of_birth” that exceeds “2015 - 10 - 25”
dogs[dogs[“color”].isin([“Black”, “Brown”])] - outputs all rows which have a “color” equal to black or brown
dogs[“height_m”] = [45,52,61,39] - creates a new column with the heading “height_m” with the data in the list

DATA MANIPULATION WITH PANDAS


Summary statistics in DataFrames

Methods in DataFrames

dogs[“height_cm”].mean() - calculates the mean of the “height_cm” column
.median()
.mode()
.min()
.max()
.var()
.std()
.sum()
.quantile()
.agg(function) - allows you to pass a defined function into the .agg method. This method allows for non-standard methods to be run on DataFrames based on what the function is
.cumsum() - calculates the cumulative sum
.cummax() - shows the maximum value seen so far
.cummin()
.cumprod()


Counting in DataFrames

.drop_duplicates(subset = ‘name’) - drop duplicates in the name column
.drop_duplicates(subset = [‘name’, ‘breed’]) - drop elements where name and breed are duplicated
dogs[‘breed’].value_counts(sort = True, normalize = True) - counts the number of dogs of each type of breed. Normalize argument turns count into proportion of the total.


Grouped summary stats in DataFrames

dogs.groupby(‘color’)[“weight_kg”].mean() - group by color, select the weight column and calculate the mean for each colour group.
dogs.groupby(‘color’)[“weight_kg”].agg([min, max, sum]) - groups data by color and calculates the min, max and sum of the weight for each group.
dogs.groupby([‘color’, ‘breed’])[“weight_kg”].mean() - groups data by color and then by breed (for each colour) and calculates the mean of the weight for each group.



Pivot tables in DataFrames
A pivot table is a DataFrame with sorted indexes

dogs.groupby(‘color’)[“weight_kg”].mean()  
OR
dogs.pivot_table(values = ‘weight_kg’, index = ‘color’) - groups data by color and calculates the mean of the weight for each colour group. By default the pivot table calculates the mean value for each group.

dogs.pivot_table(values = ‘weight_kg’, index = ‘color’, aggfunc = [np.mean, np.median]) - groups data by color and calculates the mean and median weight for each colour group

dogs.groupby([‘color’, ‘breed’])[“weight_kg”].mean() - groups data by color and then by breed (for each colour) and calculates the mean of the weight for each group. 
OR
dogs.pivot_table(values = ‘weight_kg’, index = ‘color’, columns = ‘breed’) - produces the same result although it looks a bit different. The index argument is the column to group by and display in rows. The column argument is the column to group by and display in columns. 

dogs.pivot_table(values = ‘weight_kg’, index = ‘color’, columns = ‘breed’, fill_value = 0, margins = True) - fill_value fills all missing values with 0. Margins calculates the mean for all rows and columns

You can slice pivot tables in the same way you normally would a DataFrame

.mean(axis = ‘index’) - calling the mean function on a pivot table calculates the mean on the index values i.e. by row
.mean(axis = ‘columns’) - calling the mean function on a pivot table calculates the mean on the column values i.e. by column

Explicit indexes
Setting indexes violates the ‘tidy’ data principle of Python as there is separate syntax.
DataFrames are composed of three parts:
1.	Numpy array for data
2.	Index to store row details
3.	Index to store column details

dogs.set_index(‘name’) - sets the ‘name’ column as the index i.e. the far left column. This column is indented to the left, unlike the date in the DataFrame which is indented to the right.
dogs.reset_index(inplace=True) - resets the DataFrame to its original
dogs.reset_index(drop = True) - deletes the data in the index column

dogs[dogs[‘name’].isin([‘Bella’, ‘Stella’])
OR if you subsetted the ‘name’ column and called this new object dogs_ind
dogs_ind.loc[[‘Bella’, ‘Stella’]]

REMEMBER: when subsetting multiple columns you need to use double square brackets because the inner square brackets generate a list and the outer brackets do the subsetting.

dogs.set_index([‘breed’, ‘color’]] - the inner index ‘color’ is nested inside the outer index ‘breed’

dogs.loc[[‘Labrador’,’Chihuahua’]] - subset outer index
dogs.loc[[(‘Labrador’, ‘brown’),(‘Chihuahua’, ‘black’)]] - subset inner index with tuples. The result must match both conditions

dogs.sort_index() - sorts from outer to inner (in ascending order by default)
dogs.sort_index(level = [‘color’, ‘breed’], ascending = [‘True’, ‘False’]) - controlling the sort index

dogs.set_index(‘name’).sort_index() - sets and sorts the index

dogs.loc[(‘Labrador’, ‘brown’):(‘Schnauzer’, ‘grey)] - slicing the inner index using tuples. Only use one set of square brackets when slicing (as opposed to subsetting).

dogs.iloc[2:5, 1:4] - unlike .loc the end value is exclusive

### Creating DataFrames
DataFrames can be constructed in two ways:
1.	A list of dictionaries i.e. row by row
a.	list_of_dics = [{‘name’: ‘Karl’, ‘age’: ‘24’}, {‘name’: Jack, ‘age’: ‘26’}]
2.	A dictionary of lists i.e. column by column
a.	dict_of_lists = {‘name’: [‘Karl’, ‘Jack’], ‘age’: [‘24’, ‘26’]}
Option 2 is more efficient
