## Numpy
-	Numeric Python
-	Alternative to the list
-	Can perform calculations over entire arrays unlike lists
-	Type pip3 install numpy at the command line to install
-	Numpy arrays must contain only one type

bmi > 23
Returns an array of booleans

bmi[bmi > 23]
Returns an array of the values that are greater than 23
Calling the shape attribute (N.B. no brackets after an attribute call) on an array will output the number of rows and columns in the array


### 2D Numpy array

np_2d[0][2] is the same as np_2d[0,2]
 
np_2d[ : , 1:3]
-	Outputs both rows and columns 1-3


### Numpy statistics

np.mean(np_city[ :, 0]) calculates the mean of the first column
np.median(np_city[ :, 0]) calculates the median of the first column
np.corrcoef(np_city[ :, 0], np_city[ :, 1]) calculates the correlation of the first and second columns
np.std(np_city[ :, 0] calculates the standard deviation of the first column
Also: 
np.sum() 
np.sort()
np.round()
np.random.normal(distribution mean, distribution std., number of samples)

Comparison operators in Numpy
Comparison operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
Boolean operators: and, or, not
Conditional statements: if, else, elif

import numpy as np
np.logical_and
np.logical_or 

np.logical_and(bmi > 21, bmi < 23) - output will be an array of booleans
bmi[np.logical_and(bmi > 21, bmi < 23)] - output will be the actual values in the array

Calling the nditer() function when iterating over a multidimensional Numpy array:
for val in np.nditer(meas):
	print(val)


### Random numbers

import numpy as np

np.random.seed(123) - starting from a seed number
np.random.rand() - generates pseudo random numbers based on the seed number
np.randint(0,2) - randomly generates a 0 or a 1 based on the seed number

INTRODUCTION TO NUMPY

1. Understanding Numpy Arrays

1.1 Introducing Arrays
●	Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow and Scikit Learn are built on top of Numpy
●	The array is the main object - grid like structure that holds data
●	Create 1D array (pass in a list): np.array([1,2,3,4])
●	Create 2D array (pass in a list of lists: np.array([[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]])
●	Numpy arrays must be of the same data type - makes the operation more efficient i.e. less memory space
●	np.zeros((5,3)) - takes in a tuple and creates an empty array of zeros with 5 rows and 3 columns 
○	Similar to creating an empty list [ ] which can be used as a placeholder to fill in later on
●	np.random.random((5,3)) - takes in a tuple and assigns random floats between 0 and 1 over 5 rows and 3 columns
○	np.random is the Numpy module
○	The second random in np.random.random() is the function name
●	np.arange(-3,4) - creates evenly spaced array of numbers based on a start and stop value (stop value is exclusive)
○	Passing a third argument is interpreted as the step value

Example
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(np.arange(0,7), np.arange(-3,4))
plt.show()







1.2 Array Dimensionality
●	Single number (like 3) is known as a scalar
●	1D arrays are known as vectors (neither explicitly horizontal or vertical)
○	Shape (5,) or shape (,5) would be the same
●	2D array is called as matrix
○	To create an array that is explicitly horizontal or vertical it must be a 2D array
○	Shape(5,1) or shape (1,5)
●	3D arrays + is called a tensor
●	.shape attribute for number of rows and columns
●	.flatten() takes all elements of an array and puts them in 1D (preserves the order)
●	.reshape() allows you to redefine the shape of the array
○	The new shape must contain the same number of elements as the original
○	E.g. (2,3) can be reshaped to (3,2) but not (3,3) 


1.3 Numpy Data Types
●	8 bits = 1 byte
●	int32 can store 2**32 = 4.2bn possible combinations of integers
○	This is between -2.1bn to 2.1bn
●	.dtype attribute for the data type
●	.astype() is used for type conversion
●	Type coercion - when you try to create an array with multiple data types Numpy will convert the array to one date type

Example
boolean_array = np.array([[True, False], [False, False]], dtype=np.bool_)
boolean_array.astype(np.int32)

Output
array([[1,0],
	[0,1]])


2. Selecting and Updating Data

2.1 Indexing & Slicing Arrays
●	Slicing and indexing 1D arrays is the same as with lists
●	Indexing 2D arrays: provide both row and column location to return a single element
○	E.g. array[2,4] - returns element in row 2 and column 4
○	E.g. array[0] - returns all the elements in row 1
○	E.g. array[:,2] - returns all elements in column 3
●	Slicing 1D:
○	E.g. array[2:4] - select elements between position 3 and 4
●	 Slicing 2D:
○	E.g. array[3:6, 3:6] - slices rows and then columns
●	Slicing 2D with steps:
○	E.g. array[3:6:2, 3:6:2] - step size of 2, searches for every other value
●	np.sort() - sorts the columns in a given row in the array in ascending order
○	In 2D array the direction along rows is axis 0, and along columns axis 1
○	Passing the argument axis = 0 will sort the rows in a given column in ascending order
○	Default of np.sort() is axis = 1 i.e. sort by columns















2.2 Filtering Arrays
●	Masks & fancy indexing
○	Useful when we are only interested in elements that meet a certain condition
○	Fancy indexing returns an array of the elements

Example
# create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 (stop value is exclusive)
one_to_five = np.arange(1, 6)

# the mask is an array of booleans with the same shape as the array
mask = one_to_five % 2 == 0

# index the array using the mask (fancy indexing) i.e. identify numbers in the array that are divisible by 2 (True)
one_to_five[mask]

Output
array([2, 4])


●	np.where()
○	Returns an array of the indices of elements that meet a certain condition
●	np.where(condition, how to change element if condition met, how to change element if condition not met)
○	Can also be used to replace elements with other elements

Example (fancy indexing vs np.where)
# Create the block_313879 array containing trees on block 313879 using fancy indexing
block_313879 = tree_census[tree_census[:,1] == 313879]
print(block_313879)

VS

# Create an array of row_indices for trees on block 313879 using np.where()
row_indices = np.where(tree_census[:,1] == 313879)

# Create an array which only contains data for trees on block 313879
block_313879 = tree_census[row_indices]
print(block_313879)


Example
# Create and print a 1D array, which replaces a tree's trunk diameter with its stump diameter if the trunk diameter is zero.
# Note: tree_census columns in order refer to a tree's ID, its block ID, its trunk diameter, and its stump diameter.
trunk_stump_diameters = np.where(tree_census[:, 2] == 0, tree_census[:, 3], tree_census[:, 2])
print(trunk_stump_diameters)


2.3 Adding & Removing Data
●	np.concatenate((array1, array2)) - pass a tuple of the array you wish to concatenate
○	Concatenates alongs the 1st axis (rows/axis=0) by default i.e. we add new rows/stack arrays on top of each other

●	np.concatenate((array1, array2), axis = 1) - pass axis = 1 to concatenate by column
●	The arrays you want to concatenate must have the same shape across all axis, except the one being concatenated along
○	E.g. for 2D arrays: concatenating by column, you can join a (3,3) array to a (3,1) array but not a (1,3) array i.e. both arrays must have 3 rows as we are concatenating by columns.
○	Otherwise you will get a ValueError
●	 The arrays must also have the same number of dimensions
●	np.delete() - takes 3 arguments
○	E.g. np.delete(array, 1, axis = 0) - deletes the second (1) row (axis = 0) from the array
○	If you want to delete a column, set axis = 1



3. Array Mathematics

3.1 Summarizing Data
●	.sum() - sums the entire array
○	Setting the argument axis = 0 will sum the rows in each column, creating column totals
○	Conversely, setting axis =1 creates row totals
○	When specifying the argument keepdims = True the dimensions that are collapsed when aggregating are left in the shape of the output array
■	Useful if we want to achieve dimension compatibility i.e. to concatenate
●	.min() - takes in the same arguments as .sum()
●	.max()  takes in the same arguments as .sum()
●	.mean() - takes in the same arguments as .sum()
●	.cumsum() - takes in the axis argument

Example
# Create a 2D array of total monthly sales across industries i.e. create row totals
monthly_industry_sales = monthly_sales.sum(axis=1, keepdims=True)
print(monthly_industry_sales)

# Add this column as the last column in monthly_sales
monthly_sales_with_total = np.concatenate((monthly_sales,monthly_industry_sales), axis = 1)
print(monthly_sales_with_total)


3.2 Vectorized Operations
●	Using the C programming language under the hood to perform computations efficiently
●	Multiply an array by a scalar (such as 0.05) will multiply each element in the array
●	If adding two arrays together, each array must be of the same shape. Elements from the first array are added to their corresponding element in the second array
●	Vectorizing python functions using np.vectorize()

Example
# using python functions like len does not treat each element in an array separately
# len will calculate the number of elements in the array and not the length of each element in the array
# usually we would have to write a for loop to solve this, or we can use np.vectorize()
array = np.array(["NumPy", "is", "awesome"])
len(array) > 2

Output
True

# vectorize the python len function
vectorized_len = np.vectorize(len)
vectorized_len(array) > 2
array([ True, False,  True])


3.3 Broadcasting
●	Performing mathematical operations across arrays of different shapes i.e. stretching the smaller array across the larger one
●	Adding a scalar to an array uses broadcasting
●	In order to broadcast arrays must be compatible
○	Two arrays are compatible when both of these conditions are met:
■	One set of dimensions is 1 
■	The other set of dimensions is equal 
■	E.g. shape(10,5) is compatible with shape(10,1) but not with (10,2)
●	Two arrays don’t have to have the same number of dimensions to be broadcastable
○	E.g. shape(10,5) is compatible with shape(5, ) - the second array is a 1D array which is essentially 5 ‘columns’ of data
●	The same logic applied to multiplying and subtracting

Example
Recall that when broadcasting across columns, NumPy requires you to be explicit that it should broadcast a vertical array, and horizontal and vertical 1D arrays do not exist in NumPy. Instead, you must first create a 2D array to declare that you have vertical data. Then, NumPy creates a copy of this 2D vertical array for each column and applies the desired operation.

# Convert monthly_growth_rate (currently a list) into a NumPy array and reshape it
# we reshape the 1D array into a 2D array
monthly_growth_D = np.array(monthly_growth_rate).reshape(12,1)

# Multiply each column in monthly_sales - which has shape(12,3) - by monthly_growth_2D - which has shape(12,1)
# broadcast across columns
print(monthly_sales*monthly_growth_D)


4. Array Transformations

4.1 Saving & Loading Arrays

Example
# rb is read binary
with open("logo.npy", "rb") as f:
logo_rgb_array = np.load(f)

Example
# Load the mystery_image.npy file 
# save the contents as rgb_array
# wb is ‘write binary’
# if no file is yet created for mystery_image.npy, a new file will be created, however if a file is already created it will be overwritten
with open("mystery_image.npy", mode = 'wb') as f:
    np.save(f,rgb_array)

plt.imshow(rgb_array)
plt.show()

 

4.2 Array Acrobatics
●	Data augmentation is useful in machine learning (ML) when training a model
○	Perform small manipulations on data that is already available
○	I.e. you want to train the model to recognise a bottle - you can rotate the bottle many different ways to train the model that it is still the same bottle
●	np.flip() - flips the array along every axis
○	Takes an axis keyword argument if you wish to specify the axis to manipulate
○	Setting axis = 1 flips the image along the 2nd/y-axis/column axis i.e. produces the mirror image
●	np.transpose() - changes axis order, but keeps element order within each axis the same
○	I.e. elements on row 1 now move to column 1, but maintain their order
○	Takes an axes keyword argument if you wish to specify the axis to manipulate
○	Pass the axes order you want the final array to appear in i.e. axes = (1,0,2) - columns and rows have switched

Example
# Transpose the 3-D rgb_array so that the image appears rotated 90 degrees left and as a mirror image of itself.
transposed_rgb = np.transpose(rgb_array, axes = (1,0,2))
plt.imshow(transposed_rgb)
plt.show()

 



4.3 Stacking & Splitting
●	np.split() - allows us to split arrays along its axes
●	np.stack() - allows us to concatenate data in a new dimension

Example
# Split monthly_sales into quarterly data
# rows contain months and columns contain sales data for each month
q1_sales, q2_sales, q3_sales, q4_sales = np.split(monthly_sales, 4, axis =0)

print(q1_sales)

 

# Stack the four quarterly sales arrays to create a 3 D array made up of 4 quarterly 2D arrays
quarterly_sales = np.stack([q1_sales, q2_sales, q3_sales, q4_sales], axis= 0)
print(quarterly_sales)
