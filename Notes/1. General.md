# General  

## Lists  
- Lists are mutable i.e. the object can be modified after it has been created.  
- This is unlike strings, integers, floats, tuples and dictionaries.  
- Collection of values, order matters.  
- Select, update and remove: `[]`.  
- Indexed by range of numbers.  
- Can select entire subsets.  
- `fam = [‘cat’, 1.58, 2.1, ’house, ’Liz’, 1.89, ’Jack’]`.  
- List slicing is exclusive.  
- `[start:end]`.  
- `[inclusive:exclusive]`.  

## Methods
- These are functions that are specific to Python objects.  
- Objects have methods associated, depending on the type (i.e. list, float, string etc.) of the object.  
- Methods call functions on objects.  

### Examples
`.capitalize()` - capitalizes the first letter in a word
`.replace()` - input an element for replacement, but cannot be called on a list on a single string object
`.count()`
`.index()` - gets the index number of an element in a list
`.append()` - adds inputted element into a list


### Packages
Directory of Python scripts
Each script is a module which specify functions, methods, types

# Dictionaries  

## General  

- Keys are immutable objects  
- Select, update and remove using `[ ]`  
- Indexed by range of unique keys  
- Lookup table with unique keys

### Example  

        world = {‘key1’:2, ‘key2’:4}  
        world[‘key1’]  

> Outputs `2`  

        world[‘key3’] = 6  

> Adds the `key3:6` pair to the end of the dictionary  

        world[‘key3’] = 8  

> Edits the value of `key3` to `8`  

        del(world[‘key3’]  

> Deletes the `key3:8` pair from the world dictionary  

        world = {‘key1’:value1, ‘key2’:value2}  

> Final output

---

### Methods  

Calling the .items() method when iterating over a dictionary  

        for key, value in world.items():  
            print(key + “--” + str(value))

Task 3
# Convert Installs to float data type
apps['Installs'] = apps['Installs'].astype(float)

# Convert Price to float data type
apps['Price'] = apps['Price'].astype(float)

# Checking dtypes of the apps dataframe
print(apps.dtypes)


Task 4
# Print the total number of unique categories
num_categories = len(apps["Category"].unique())
print('Number of categories = ', num_categories)

# Count the number of apps in each 'Category'. 
num_apps_in_category = apps['Category'].value_counts()

# Sort num_apps_in_category in descending order based on the count of apps in each category
sorted_num_apps_in_category = num_apps_in_category.sort_values(ascending = False)
