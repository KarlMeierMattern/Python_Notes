# Functions & Expressions  

## If statements   

### Syntax  
    if: condition  
	    print()  
    elif: condition  
	    print()  
    else:  
	    print()  

## While loops  
- While loop creates a repeated if statement.
- Repeats an action until a condition is met.

### Syntax  
while condition:
	expression  

#### Example  
    exit = ""  
    while exit != "yes":  
      print("🥳")  
      exit = input("Exit?: ")  
> Creates a way the user can exit the loop via an input  

## For loops  
- For each variable in a sequence execute an expression.  
- Iterates through a list or an array.  
- To control how many times the for loop iterates use the range() function.  

### Syntax  
    for var in seq:  
      expression  

#### Example  
    for x in range(10):  
      expression  

### Detailed example  
    chars_to_remove = ['+',",","$"]  
>List of characters to remove   
    cols_to_clean = ["Installs","Price"]  
> List of column names to clean  

    for col in cols_to_clean:  
> Loop for each column in cols_to_clean  
      for char in chars_to_remove:  
> Loop for each char in chars_to_remove  
        apps[col] = apps[col].apply(lambda x: x.replace(char, ''))  
> Replace the character with an empty string  

---

### Functions

max() is a function as you can call it on a list

fam = [4,6,10,3,9]
I.e. max(fam)

round(number, decimal places) 
By default it rounds to zero decimal places

len() - can call on a string or list (will count number of elements in the list)

PYTHON DATA SCIENCE TOOLBOX (PART 1)

1. Writing your own functions

Strings in Python
Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together.

Docstrings
-	Describe what the function does
-	Placed immediately after the function header
-	“““Placed between triple quotation marks”””


Function header

Define the function
def shout(word):
	shout_loud = word + “!!!”
	print(shout_loud)

Call the function
shout(“congratulations”)
	
Note that shout(word), the part of the header that specifies the function name and parameter(s), is known as the signature of the function.

Function body
Function bodies need to be indented by a consistent number of spaces and the choice of 4 is common.

Return vs Print
The return keyword lets you return values from functions. Returning values is generally more desirable than printing them out because a print() call assigned to a variable has type NoneType.


Multiple parameters and return values

Tuples: immutable (cannot modify values once constructed), defined using ( ) brackets

def raise_both(value1, value2):
   """Raise value1 to the power of value2 and vice versa."""
					
   new_value1 = value1 ** value2
   new_value2 = value2 ** value1
		
   new_tuple = (new_value1, new_value2) - stores the result as a tuple
   return new_tuple

Note that the return statement return x, y has the same result as return (x, y): the former actually packs x and y into a tuple under the hood!


2. Default arguments, variable-length arguments and scope

Scope and user-defined functions
Global scope: defined in the main body of a script
Local scope: defined inside a function
Built-in scope: pre-defined built-in functions

Global keyword
Defining a variable as global within the function means any call to that variable (like print(x)) in the main body of code, takes the variable value from within the function. This would not otherwise be the case if the global keyword was not used as this variable is defined locally.

Built-in functions
To access a list of the built-in functions

import builtins - the name builtins is not itself builtin therefore we must import it
dir(builtins) - prints a list of the builtin function

Nested functions
Useful when we want to use a process a number of times to improve efficiency

def outer(...):
	x = …

	def inner(...): 

#nested/inner function
	
y = x ** 2
	return …

Python first searches the local scope inner to find x, and if it doesn’t find it, it searches the scope of the function outer. The function outer is known as an enclosing function as it encloses the function inner. If Python can’t find x in the scope of the enclosing function it searches the global scope and then the built-in scope

Name references will search at 4 scope levels, in this order (LEGB):
1.	Local scope
2.	Enclosing functions
3.	Global
4.	Built-in

N.B. assigning names will only create or change local names, unless these changes are preceded by the statement global or nonlocal. The keyword nonlocal is used in the inner function to create and change names in the enclosing scope (outer function).

Nonlocal is similar in meaning to global. But it takes effect primarily in nested methods. It means "not a global or local variable." So it changes the identifier to refer to an enclosing method's variable.

Nested functions 1

# Define three_shouts
def three_shouts(word1, word2, word3):
   """Returns a tuple of strings
   concatenated with '!!!'."""

   # Define inner
   def inner(word):
       """Returns a string concatenated with '!!!'."""
       return word + '!!!'

   # Return a tuple of strings
   return (inner(word1), inner(word2), inner(word3))

# Call three_shouts() and print
print(three_shouts('a', 'b', 'c'))


Closure
In data science closure refers to when the nested or inner function remembers the state of its enclosing scope when called. Thus, anything defined locally in the enclosing/outer scope is available to the inner function even when the outer function has finished execution.


Default arguments

In order to create a default argument, when defining the argument in the function header use the equals sign:

def power (num, pow = 1):
	new_value = num ** pow
	return new_value

Calls to the power function
1.	power(9,2) - we have changed the default argument to equal 2
2.	power(9,1) - equivalent to power(9)
3.	power(9) - the default argument is set to 1 and so doesn’t need to be specified in the call


Flexible arguments
Useful when don’t know how many arguments there will be

def add_all(*args):
# turns all the arguments passed to it into a tuple

	sum_all = 0 
	
	for num in args:
		sum_all += args

	return sum_all


Call the function with any number of arguments
add_all (4,6,8,3,5)
	
26


Keyword argument
Argument preceded by identifiers.
Turns the identifier keyword pairs into a dictionary within the function body


Calling the .items() method when iterating over a dictionary:

def print_all(**kwargs):
# print out key-value pairs in **kwargs

for key, value in kwargs.items():
		print(key + “--” + str(value))
		# prints all the key-value pairs stored in the dictionary kwargs

print_all(name=”Karl”, age=26, sex=”male’)

Note: the names *args and **kwargs are not important - it is the asterisk/star preceded by the name that matters.





Bringing it all together Part 2
Using *args and iterating over column name args.
Notice the difference in the line item for extracting a column from the DataFrame to the code above.
tweets_df = pd.read_csv(“tweets.csv”)

# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, *args):
   """Return a dictionary with counts of
   occurrences as value for each key."""
  
   #Initialize an empty dictionary: cols_count
   cols_count = {}
  
   # Iterate over column names in args
   for col_name in args:
  
       # Extract column from DataFrame: col
       col = df[col_name]
  
       # Iterate over the column in DataFrame
       for entry in col:
  
           # If entry is in cols_count, add 1
           if entry in cols_count.keys():
               cols_count[entry] += 1
  
           # Else add the entry to cols_count, set the value to 1
           else:
               cols_count[entry] = 1

   # Return the cols_count dictionary
   return cols_count

# Call count_entries(): result1
result1 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Call count_entries(): result2
result2 = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang','source')

# Print result1 and result2
print(result1)
print(result2)



3. Lambda functions and error handling

Lambda functions
Useful for writing simple functions quickly.

raise_to_power = lambda x: y = x**y

raise_to_power(2,4)

We specify the names of the arguments.
After the colon we specify what we want the function to do.


Anonymous functions (using lambda)
The functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function with def.
Passes the function over all elements of a sequence i.e. on a unitary basis.
Lambda functions include: map(), filter() and reduce()


Map

nums = [2,4,6,8]

square_all = map(lambda num: num **2, nums)

print(list(square_all)) - must pass to list function first as this is a map object


Filter
Used to filter out elements from a list that don’t satisfy a specified criteria.


Create, from an input list of strings, a new list that contains only strings that have more than 6 characters:

fellowship = ['frodo', 'samwise', 'merry', 'pippin', 'aragorn', 'boromir', 'legolas', 'gimli', 'gandalf']

result = filter(lambda member: len(member) > 6 , fellowship)

print(list(result))


Reduce
The reduce() function is useful for performing some computation on a list and, unlike map() and filter(), returns a single value as a result. To use reduce(), you must import it from the functools module.

from functools import reduce

stark = ['robb', 'sansa', 'arya', 'brandon', 'rickon']

result = reduce(lambda item1, item2: item1 + item2, stark)

print(result)


Error handling
Exceptions - errors caught during execution.
Use the try-except clause. Runs the code following try, but if it can’t then it runs the code following except.


Example

def sqrt(x):
	“““Returns the square root of a number”””
if x < 0:
raise ValueError(‘x must be non-negative’)	
try:
		return x ** 0.5
	except TypeError:
		print(‘x must be an integer or a float’)


Bringing it all together example

def count_entries(df, col_name='lang'):
    if col_name not in df.columns:
        raise ValueError('The DataFrame does not have a ' + col_name + ' column.')

PYTHON DATA SCIENCE TOOLBOX (PART 2)

1. Using iterators in PythonLand

Iterables
-	Lists, strings, range objects, dictionaries and file connections are all iterables. There are many others.
-	It is an object that has an associated iter method. Once applied to an iterable, an iterator is created.
-	So an iterable is an object that can return an iterator once the iter() method is applied to it.
-	An iterator keeps state and produces the next value when you call next() on it.
-	Under the hood a for loop performs the above functionality i.e. you can either use a for loop or the above functionality utilizing the next() method.
-	You use the iter() function to get an iterator object, and the next() function to retrieve the values one by one from the iterator object.

Iterator
-	An object that has an associated next() method that produces the consecutive values

Next() method

Example 1
word = ‘da’		iterable
it = iter(word)		iterator
next(it)		retrieving values from the iterator object

‘d’

next(it)

‘a’

Example 2
Recall that range() doesn't actually create the list; instead, it creates a range object with an iterator that produces the values until it reaches the limit.

for i in range(4):
	print(i)

The above is equivalent to:

small_value = iter(range(4))
print(next(small_value)
print(next(small_value)
print(next(small_value)

Iterating all at once
Using the * character to iterate over a sequence all at once.

Example (using the splat * operator)
# prints everything

word = ‘da’
it = iter(word)
print(*it)

d a

Iterating over dictionaries
Using the items() method

for key, value in dict_name.items():
	print(key, value)

Iterating over file connections

file  = open(‘file.txt’)
it = iter(file)
print(next(it))

This is the first line

print(next(it))

This is the second line


Enumerate
A function that takes any iterable as a function (such as a list) and returns an enumerate object.
The enumerate object is also an iterable.
Enumerate() returns an enumerate object that produces a sequence of tuples, and each of the tuples is an index-value pair.

Enumerate and unpack

for index, value in enumerate(avengers):
	print(index, value)

Output
0 hawkeye
1 iron man
2 thor

for index, value in enumerate(avengers, start = 10): #starts at index 10
	print(index, value)


Zip()
A zip() object is an iterator of tuples.

Example
# creating a list of tuples
avengers = [‘thor’, ‘iron man’]
names = [‘batman’, ‘spider man’]

z = zip(avengers, names)
z_list = list(z)
print(z_list)

Output
[(‘thor’,’batman’), (‘iron man’,’spider man’)]


Alternative 1
for a, b in zip(avengers, names):
	print(a, b)

Output
thor batman
iron man spider man


Alternative 2 (using the splat * operator)
avengers = [‘thor’, ‘iron man’]
names = [‘batman’, ‘spider man’]
z = zip(avengers, names)
print(*z)  # print the tuples by unpacking with *

Output
(‘thor’,’batman’) (‘iron man’,’spider man’)

Unzip the above
z = zip(avengers, names) # recreate a zip object
result 1, result 2 = zip(*z) # unzip by unpacking with *
print(result1)
print(result2)

Output
(‘thor’, ‘iron man’)
(‘batman’, ‘spider man’)


Using iterators to load large files in chunks
Sometimes, the data we have to process reaches a size that is too much for a computer's memory to handle. A solution to this is to process an entire data source chunk by chunk, instead of a single go all at once.

import pandas as pd
result = [ ]
for chunk in pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’, chunksize = 1000):
# the object created by read_csv is an iterable i.e. it can be iterated over
# each chunk will be a DataFrame
	result.append(sum(chunk[‘x’]))
	# compute the sum of the column of interest and append it to the list
# we are breaking up the ‘x’ column into 1000 chunks and calculating the sum of each chunk
total = sum(result)
# gives the total sum 

Alternatively
total = 0
for chunk in pd.read_csv(‘data.csv’, chunksize = 1000):
	total += sum(chunk[‘x’])
print(total)


2. List comprehensions and generators
List comprehensions condense for loops for building lists into a single line of code.
List comprehensions can be written over any iterable.
The tradeoff is that you sacrifice some readability with list comprehensions.
You cannot loop or build list comprehensions over integers

Components:
-	Iterable
-	Iterator variable (analogous to the loop variable)
-	Output expression

[[output expression] for iterator variable in iterable]

Example 1

nums = [12, 8, 21]

For loop
new_nums = [ ]
for num in nums:
	new_nums.append(num + 1)
print(new_nums)

VS

List comprehension
new_nums = [num + 1 for num in nums]
print(new_nums)


Example 2
A list comprehension that produces a list of the square of the numbers in the range 0 to 9

square_nums = [i ** 2 for i in range(0,10)]
print(square_nums)

Nested list comprehensions

# Create a 5 x 5 matrix using a list of lists: matrix
matrix = [[col for col in range(0,5)] for row in range(0,5)]
# [col for col in range(0,5)] is the output we want and for each output (or ‘row’ as the iterator variable is called) we are going to loop through this 4 times


# Print the matrix
# This part of the code places each list on a separate line
for row in matrix:
    print(row)

Output
matrix = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]


Conditionals in comprehensions

[ output expression for iterator variable in iterable if predicate expression ]

Example (conditional statement in the predicate expression)
[num ** 2 for num in range(0,10) if num % 2 == 0 else 0]

Output
[0, 0, 4, 0, 16, 0, 36, 0, 64, 0]

Alternatively (conditional statement in the output expression)
[num ** 2 if num % 2 == 0 else 0 for num in range(9)]


Dictionary comprehensions
Use curly brackets instead of square brackets

{num: -num for num in range(4)}

Output
{0:0, 1:-1, 2:-2, 3:-3, 4:-4}


Generator expressions
Similar to a list comprehension but it does not store the list in memory, it returns a generator object.
Helps with preserving computing power.
Functions like .items(),and range(), for example, are generator expressions. When you use these functions, Python creates generators for you behind the scenes.
It is an object we can iterate over.
Use ( ) instead of [ ]

Example 1
(num for num in range(3))

Example 2
result = (num for num in range(3)
# pass the generator object to the function list
print(list(result))

Output
[0, 1, 2, 3]

Example 3
result = (num for num in range(3)
print(next(result)

Output
0

print(next(result)

Output
1

Example 4
results = (num for num in range(3))

for num in result():
	print(num)

Output
0
1
2
3


Generator functions
When called they produce generator objects.
Defined like a regular function with def.
However, instead of using return to return values, we use the yield keyword.

Example
def num_sequence(n):
	i = 0
	while i < n:
		yield i
		i += 1

Call the function
result = num_sequence(3)
for item in result:
	print(item)

Output
0
1
2


3. Bringing it all together

Processing data in chunks
To begin, you need to open a connection to this file using what is known as a context manager. For example, the command with open('datacamp.csv') as datacamp binds the csv file 'datacamp.csv' as datacamp in the context manager. Here, the with statement is the context manager, and its purpose is to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated when opening a connection to a file.

Using a generator to load data
Generators allow users to lazily evaluate data. This concept of lazy evaluation is useful when you have to deal with very large datasets because it lets you generate values in an efficient manner by yielding only chunks of data at a time instead of the whole thing at once.

.readline() - reads a line from a file

Writing an iterator to load data in chunks
def plot_pop(filename, country_code):

    # Initialize reader object: urb_pop_reader
    urb_pop_reader = pd.read_csv(filename, chunksize=1000)

    # Initialize empty DataFrame: data
    data = pd.DataFrame()
    
    # Iterate over each DataFrame chunk
    for x in urb_pop_reader:
        df_pop_ceb = x[x['CountryCode'] == country_code]

        # Zip DataFrame columns of interest: pops
        pops = zip(df_pop_ceb['Total Population'],
                    df_pop_ceb['Urban population (% of total)'])

        # Turn zip object into list: pops_list
        pops_list = list(pops)

        # Use list comprehension to create new DataFrame column 'Total Urban Population'
       df_pop_ceb['Total Urban Population'] = [int(tup[0] * tup[1] * 0.01) for tup in pops_list]
    
        # Append DataFrame chunk to data: data
        data = data.append(df_pop_ceb)


WRITING FUNCTIONS IN PYTHON


1. Best practices
●	Popular docstring formats:
○	Google style
○	Numpydoc

Google style
Numpy Doc

Retrieving docstrings
●	We don’t want to call the function. Instead treat the function like an object:
○	The call would be: the_answer.__doc__ and NOT the_answer().__doc__

 

Immutable vs Mutable data types


Note
When you need to set a mutable variable as a default argument, always use None and then set the value in the body of the function. This prevents unexpected behavior like adding multiple columns if you call the function more than once.
 
Example
# Use an immutable variable for the default argument
def better_add_column(values, df=None):

# Update the function to create a default DataFrame
    if df is None:
    df = pandas.DataFrame()
  df['col_{}'.format(len(df.columns))] = values
  return df



2. Context managers

2.1 Using context managers
●	Sets up a context, runs code and then removes the context

Syntax
with <context manager>(<args>) as <variable name>:
	# This code runs inside the context
# This code runs after the context is removed

Example
# ‘open’ sets up a context by opening a file, lets you run any code on that file and then removes the context by closing the file
with open('alice.txt') as file:
  text = file.read()

n = 0
for word in text.split():
  if word.lower() in ['cat', 'cats']:
    n += 1

# fstring literal
print(f “Lewis Carroll uses the word "cat" {n} times”)


2.2 Writing context managers (using decorators)
●	Two ways to define a context manager:
○	Class based
○	Function based: a context manager function is technically a generator that yields a single value

Function based
# Decorate the function with the contextmanager decorator from the contextlib module
@contextlib.contextmanager
# Define a function
def my_context():
	# add set-up code
	# use the yield keyword
	yield
	# add any tear-down code



Example
Create a read-only version of the open() context manager. This function is an example of a context manager that does return a value, so we write yield read_only_file instead of just yield. Then the read_only_file object gets assigned to my_file in the with statement so that whoever is using your context can call its .read() method in the context block.

@contextlib.contextmanager
def open_read_only(filename):
  """Open a file in read-only mode.

  Args:
    filename (str): The location of the file to read

  Yields:
    file object
  """
  read_only_file = open(filename, mode='r')
  # Yield read_only_file so it can be assigned to my_file
  yield read_only_file
  # Close read_only_file
  read_only_file.close()

with open_read_only('my_file.txt') as my_file:
  print(my_file.read())



2.3 Advanced topics

Nested contexts

Example
def copy(src, dst):
  # Open both files
  # Open the file to read from
  with open(src) as f_src:
    # Open the file to write to
    with open(dst, 'w') as f_dst:
      # Read and write each line, one at a time
      for line in f_src:
        f_dst.write(line)


When to use a context manager
●	When you need to open/close file paths etc.
 

3. Decorators

3.1 Functions as objects
●	Decorators modify the behavior of functions
●	Functions are just another type of object

Example
def create_math_function(func_name):
  if func_name == 'add':
    # Define the add() function
    def add(a, b):
      return a + b
    # Return the add function back to the main function create_math_function
    return add
  elif func_name == 'subtract':
    # Define the subtract() function
    def subtract(a,b):
      return a - b
    return subtract
  else:
    print("I don't know that one")
    
# Calling the functions
add = create_math_function('add')
print('5 + 2 = {}'.format(add(5, 2)))

subtract = create_math_function('subtract')
print('5 - 2 = {}'.format(subtract(5, 2)))


3.2 Scope
●	In the case of nested functions, Python checks the scope of the parent function before checking the global function i.e. the local scope is the nested function and the nonlocal scope is the parent function
○	Nonlocal means it is not the local scope of the child function and not the global scope


●	The global variable is used when you are inside a function (in the local scope) and want to update the variable in the global scope
●	However, try to avoid using the global variable as it makes testing and debugging tricky



●	Use the nonlocal variable when you are inside a nested function and want to update the variable inside the parent function


3.3 Closures

Nonlocal variables
●	Variables defined in the parent function that are used by the child function
Closure
●	Nonlocal variables that are attached to a returned function


Example 1

def parent(arg_1, arg_2):
  value = 22
  my_dict = {'chocolate': 'yummy'}

# Python’s way of attaching nonlocal variables to a returned function so that a function can operate even when called outside of the parent’s scope i.e. value and my_dict variables
  def child():
    print(2 * value)
    print(my_dict['chocolate'])
    print(arg_1 + arg_2)

  return child

new_function = parent(3, 4)
print([cell.cell_contents for cell in new_function.__closure__])

Example 2
Values passed to return_a_func() are still accessible to the new function returned, even after the program left the scope of return_a_func().

Values get added to a function's closure in the order they are defined in the enclosing function (in this case, arg1 and then arg2), but only if they are used in the nested function. That is, if return_a_func() took a third argument (e.g., arg3) that wasn't used by new_func(), then it would not be captured in new_func()'s closure.

def return_a_func(arg1, arg2):
  def new_func():
    print('arg1 was {}'.format(arg1))
    print('arg2 was {}'.format(arg2))
  return new_func
    
my_func = return_a_func(2, 17)

print(my_func.__closure__ is not None)
print(len(my_func.__closure__) == 2)

# Get the values of the variables in the closure
closure_values = [my_func.__closure__[i].cell_contents for i in range(2)]
print(closure_values == [2, 17])

Output
 



3.4 Decorators
●	Functions that take another function as an argument and return a modified version of that function

Example
Version 1 (using decorator syntax)
# assuming we have written the double_args decorator elsewhere, which doubles the arguments passed to the function
# we are decorating the multiply function
@double_args
def multiply(a, b):
  return a * b
multiply(1, 5)

Output
20

Version 2 (redefining the multiply function)
def multiply(a, b):
  return a * b
def double_args(func):
  def wrapper(a, b):
    return func(a * 2, b * 2)
  return wrapper
multiply = double_args(multiply)
multiply(1, 5)

Output
20

Note
The @double_args before the definition of my_function is exactly equivalent to multiply = double_args(multiply). Remember, even though decorators are functions themselves, when you use decorator syntax with the @ symbol you do not include the parentheses after the decorator name.



4. More on decorators
●	Use a decorator when you want to add some common code to multiple functions

4.1 Real-world examples

Example
The timer functions is useful for finding the slow parts of your code

import time

 def timer(func):

  """A decorator that prints how long a function took to run."""
  # Define the wrapper function to return.
  # wrapper takes any number of positional and key-word arguments so that it can be used to decorate any function
# this is the function that the decorator will return
  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):

    # When wrapper() is called, get the current time.
    t_start = time.time()

    # Call the decorated function and store the result.
    result = func(*args, **kwargs)

    # Get the total time it took to run, and print it.
    t_total = time.time() - t_start
    print(f”{func.__name__} took {t_total}s”)

    return result
  return wrapper

Using timer()
@timer
def sleep_n_seconds(n):
  time.sleep(n)


4.2 Decorators and metadata
●	When trying to access the metadata (such as docstrings, name or arguments) of the decorated function you will run into problems as you will be referencing the metadata of the nested function (i.e. the wrapper() function) that was returned by the decorator.
●	To solve this do the following:

Example
from functools import wraps

def timer(func):

	# use @wraps to decorate the wrapper function
	# this modifies the metadata of wrapper to look like the function you are decorating
	@wraps(func)
	def wrapper(*args, **kwargs)
	“	“
	return wrapper

Result
@timer
def sleep_n_seconds(n=10):
  """Pause processing for n seconds.
  Args:
    n (int): The number of seconds to pause for.
"""
  time.sleep(n)
print(sleep_n_seconds.__doc__)

Output
# the docstring of the decorated function is now appropriately displayed
Pause processing for n seconds.
 Args:
   n (int): The number of seconds to pause for.


4.3 Decorators that take arguments
●	Have to first turn the decorator into a function that returns a decorator (rather than a function that is a decorator)
○	This is because the original decorator function can only take another function as its argument

Example
def run_n_times(n):
  """Define and return a decorator"""
  def decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
      for i in range(n):
        func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
  return decorator

# when we call @run_n_times notice that we use curly brackets
# we call the decorator by adding parentheses
# we are calling the function run_ n_times and decorating print_sum with the result of that function call
@run_n_times(3)
def print_sum(a, b):
print(a + b)

Result
