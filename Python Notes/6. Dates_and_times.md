# Working with dates and times  

## Dates and calendars  

### Example 1  

  from datetime import date
  
  hurricane_andrew = date(1992, 8, 24)
  print(hurricane_andrew.weekday())

> Create a date object.  
> Pass in the date (year, month, day) to the date object.  
> Use the weekday method.  

## Methods & attributes  
- `weekday()` - returns 0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday etc.  
- `.year`  
- `.month`  
- `.day`  

Example 2
# Counter for how many before June 1
# Initialise an empty counter
early_hurricanes = 0

# We loop over the dates
# florida_hurrican_dates contains a list of dates from 1950 - 2017
for hurricane in florida_hurricane_dates:
  # Check if the month is before June (month number 6)
  if hurricane.month < 6:
    early_hurricanes = early_hurricanes + 1
    

Math with dates
●	When subtracting dates you get an object ‘time delta’
○	Access the .days attribute of this object to get the number of days
●	When adding days to dates refer to the example below

Example 1 (subtracting)
from datetime import date

# Create a date object for May 9th, 2007
start = date(2007, 5, 9)

# Create a date object for December 13th, 2007
end = date(2007, 12, 13)

# Subtract the two dates and print the number of days
print((end - start).days)

Example 2 (adding)
from datetime import timedelta

# Create a 29 day timedelta
d1 = date(2017, 11, 5)
td = timedelta(days=29)
print(d1 + td)

Output
2017-12-04

Example 3
# Put the dates in order
# You can use sorted() on several data types in Python, including sorting lists of numbers, lists of strings, or even lists of lists
dates_ordered = sorted(dates_scrambled)

# Print the first and last scrambled dates
print(dates_scrambled[0])
print(dates_scrambled[-1])


Turning dates into strings
●	Convert from datetime object into a string using isoformat() and strftime()
●	ISO 8601 format is YYYY-MM-DD
○	This format can be sorted using the sorted() method

Every other format
●	Use d.strftime())
○	d.strftime(‘%Y’) lets you pass a format string which Python uses to format the date
○	d.strftime(‘%Y/%m/%d’’)
○	%B will print out the name of the month written out in full
○	%j will print out the day in the year (out of 365 days)

Example
# Assign the earliest date to first_date
first_date = min(florida_hurricane_dates)

# Convert to ISO and US formats
iso = "Our earliest hurricane date: " + first_date.isoformat()
us = "Our earliest hurricane date: " + first_date.strftime("%m/%d/%Y")

print("ISO: " + iso)
print("US: " + us)


2. Combining dates and times

Dates and times

Example 1
Write the date and time October 1, 2017 3:23:25 PM
# Import datetime
from datetime import datetime
dt = datetime(2017, 10, 1, 15, 23, 25, 500000)

Example 2 (alternative using explicit assignment)
# Import datetime
from datetime import datetime
dt = datetime(year=2017, month=10, day=1, hour=15, minute=23, second=25, microsecond=500000)

Example 3
# Use the .replace method to alter the date and time
new_dt = dt.replace(minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

Example 4
# Create dictionary to hold results
trip_counts = {'AM': 0, 'PM': 0}
  
# Loop over all trips
for trip in onebike_datetimes:
  # Check to see if the trip starts before noon using the .hour attribute
  if trip['start'].hour < 12:
    # Increment the counter for before noon
    trip_counts['AM'] += 1
  else:
    # Increment the counter for after noon
    trip_counts['PM'] += 1
  
print(trip_counts)


Printing and parsing datetimes

Example
# Create datetime
dt = datetime(2017, 12, 30, 15, 19, 13)
print(dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
print(dt.isoformat())

Parsing datetimes with strptime
●	strftime() and strptime() are the opposite of one another
○	strftime() create strings from date objects
○	strptime() create date objects from strings
Example 1
# Import datetime
from datetime import datetime

# Pass in the string we want to parse as well as the format string
# dt will be a string representation of the datetime when printed
dt = datetime.strptime("12/30/2017 15:19:13", "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")


Example 2
Some computers store time as the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 (Unix timestamp)

# A timestamp of the number of seconds
ts = 1514665153.0
# Convert to datetime and print
print(datetime.fromtimestamp(ts))

Example 3

Input
 

# Write down the format string
fmt = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"

# Initialize a list for holding the pairs of datetime objects
onebike_datetimes = [ ]

# Loop over all trips
for (start, end) in onebike_datetime_strings:
  trip = {'start': datetime.strptime(start, fmt),
          'end': datetime.strptime(end, fmt)}
  
  # Append the trip
  onebike_datetimes.append(trip)

Output
 


Working with durations


Example 1
# Create example datetimes
start = datetime(2017, 10, 8, 23, 46, 47)
end = datetime(2017, 10, 9, 0, 10, 57)

# Subtract datetimes to create a timedelta
duration = end - start

# Subtract datetimes to create a timedelta
print(duration.total_seconds())

N.B.
# Calling the .seconds attribute will print the number of seconds and omit the number of days
# Whereas total_seconds() prints the number of seconds and days of elapsed time
print(duration.seconds)


Example 2 (creating timedeltas)
# Import timedelta
from datetime import timedelta

# Create a one day and one second timedelta
delta2 = timedelta(days=1, seconds=1)
 
# One day and one second later
print(start + delta2)



3. Time zones and daylight savings

UTC offsets
●	All clocks are set relative to UTC (also called GMT)
●	UTC is the the UK
●	Moving east is +UTC and moving west is -UTC
●	Setting a timezone tells datetime how to align itself to UTC

Example 1
# Import relevant classes
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

# US Eastern Standard time zone
ET = timezone(timedelta(hours=-5))

# Timezone-aware datetime
# If tzinfo is not set, then datetime is timezone naive
dt = datetime(2017, 12, 30, 15, 9, 3, tzinfo = ET)

print(dt)

Output
Shows the UTC offset i.e. shows UTC and the time delta
I.e. clocks in the US Eastern time would be showing 10:09:03
 

Example 2 (adjusting timezones)
●	When you need to move a datetime from one timezone to another

# India Standard time zone
IST = timezone(timedelta(hours=5, minutes=30))

# Convert to IST
print(dt.astimezone(IST))

Output
1:39:03 is the time in India which is 5hr30min past UTC
 

Distinguishing between adjusting timezones and changing tzinfo
●	print(dt.replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc))
○	Changes the tzinfo argument to equal UTC meaning there is 0 offset
○	The clock stays the same, but the UTC offset changes

 

●	print(dt.astimezone(timezone.utc))
○	Changes both the clock itself and the UTC offset
○	In this instance this is the actual UTC time

 


Timezone database
●	There is a database of the timezones called tz
●	Format ‘Continent/City’
●	Used as an alternative to specifying the UTC offset yourself

Example 1
# Imports
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil import tz

# Eastern time
et = tz.gettz('America/New_York')

# Last ride
# Instead of specifying the UTC offset yourself you pass in the timezone you got from et
last = datetime(2017, 12, 30, 15, 9, 3, tzinfo=et)
print(last)

Output
 

Example 2
# Create the timezone object
uk = tz.gettz('Europe/London')

# Pull out the start of the first trip
local = onebike_datetimes[0]['start']

# What time was it in the UK?
notlocal = local.astimezone(uk)

# Print them out and see the difference
print(local.isoformat())
print(notlocal.isoformat())

Output
●	The first shows the original time relative UTC
●	The second shows the time relative to London (UTC +1) i.e. shows the UK timezone
 


Daylight saving time (daylight shifting time)
●	Clocks move forward in spring
●	Clocks move back in autumn
●	When we compare times in local time zones, everything gets converted into clock time. Remember if you want to get absolute time differences, always move to UTC!
○	Use df.astimezone(timezone.utc) to convert to UTC time

Ending daylight saving time
●	Clock gets pushed back
●	Map everything back to UTC
●	Use tz.enfold to fold over the duplicate times, when the clock gets pushed back
○	tz.enfold takes the new enfolded time i.e. the time that was pushed back

Example 1
from dateutil import tz

# Loop over trips
for trip in onebike_datetimes:

  # Rides with ambiguous start
  # Ambiguous times are when there are two overlapping times due to daylight saving ending
  if tz.datetime_ambiguous(trip['start']):
    print("Ambiguous start at " + str(trip['start']))

  # Rides with ambiguous end
  if tz.datetime_ambiguous(trip['end']):
    print("Ambiguous end at " + str(trip['end']))


Example 2
from datetime import timezone
from dateutil import tz

trip_durations = []

for trip in onebike_datetimes:
  # When the start is later than the end, set the fold to be 1
  if trip['start'] > trip['end']:
    trip['end'] = tz.enfold(trip['end'])

  # Convert to UTC
  start = trip['start'].astimezone(timezone.utc)
  end = trip['end'].astimezone(timezone.utc)

  # Subtract the difference
  trip_length_seconds = (end-start).total_seconds()
  trip_durations.append(trip_length_seconds)

# Take the shortest trip duration
print("Shortest trip: " + str(min(trip_durations)))

Note
Since Python does not handle tz.enfold() when doing arithmetic, we must put our datetime objects into UTC, where ambiguities have been resolved (using timezone.utc)



4. Easy and powerful: dates and times in Pandas

Loading a .csv file in Pandas

Example 1
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV into the rides variable
rides = pd.read_csv('capital-onebike.csv', 
                    parse_dates = ['Start date','End date'])

Example 2
# Subtract the start date from the end date
ride_durations = rides['End date'] - rides['Start date']

# Convert the results to seconds and create a new columnf
rides['Duration'] = ride_durations.dt.total_seconds()


Summarizing datetime data in Pandas
●	.resample() is the same as groupby but allows you to groupby time i.e. ‘M’ is month, ‘D’ is days etc.
●	Whereas .resample() groups rows by some time or date information, .groupby() groups rows based on the values in one or more columns.
●	.resample() can be called after .groupby(). For example, how long was the median ride by month, and by Membership type?

Example 1
# Import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Resample rides to monthly, take the size, plot the results
rides.resample('M', on = 'Start date')\
  .size()\
  .plot(ylim = [0, 150])

# Show the results
plt.show()

Example 2
# Resample rides to be monthly on the basis of Start date
monthly_rides = rides.resample('M', on = 'Start date')['Member type']

# Take the ratio of the .value_counts() over the total number of rides
# .value_counts() counts the number of member and casual rides
# .size() counts the total number of rides
print(monthly_rides.value_counts() / monthly_rides.size())

Example 3
# Group rides by member type, and resample to the month
grouped = rides.groupby('Member type').resample('M', on = 'Start date')

# Print the median duration for each group
print(grouped['Duration'].median())


Additional datetime methods in Pandas


Example 1
# Localize the Start date column to America/New_York
# dt.tz_localize sets a new timezone, but keeps date and time the same
rides['Start date'] = rides['Start date'].dt.tz_localize('America/New_York', ambiguous='NaT')

# Print first value
print(rides['Start date'].iloc[0])

# Convert the Start date column to Europe/London
# dt.tz_convert changes the date and time to match a new timezone
rides['Start date'] = rides['Start date'].dt.tz_convert('Europe/London')

# Print the new value
print(rides['Start date'].iloc[0])


Example 2
# Add a column for the weekday of the start of the ride
rides['Ride start weekday'] = rides['Start date'].dt.day_name()

# Print the median trip time per weekday
print(rides.groupby('Ride start weekday')['Duration'].median())
