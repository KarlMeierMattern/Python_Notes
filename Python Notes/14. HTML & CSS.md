## Rendering .html file from .py file  
- We are pulling in an HTML file called `portfolio.html`.  
- Rember to `import render_template`.  
- Within the HTML file we included placeholders for `name`, `title`, and `text`, which we can now submit replacements for.  

        from flask import Flask, render_template

        app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='templates')

        @app.route("/")
        def index():
          return "Hello there"

        @app.route('/home')
        def home():
          print("Rendering portfolio.html")
          return render_template('portfolio.html', name='John Doe', title='My Title', text='Lorem ipsum...')

        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000, debug=True)

> Use this URL in the web browser: http://localhost:5000/

## Form   

    <form method = "post" action = "/process">

        <p>Name: <input type="text" name="username" required> </p>
        <p>Email: <input type="Email" name="email"> </p>
        <p>Website: <input type="url" name="website"> </p>
        <p>Age: <input type="number" name="age"> </p>
        <p>Password: <input type="password" name="password" required></p>
        <p><input type="hidden" name="userID" value="232"> </p>
        <p>
          Fave Baldy: 
          <select name="baldies">
            <option value = "david">David</option>
            <option value = "jean luc">Jean Luc Picard</option>
            <option value = "yul">Yul Brynner</option>
          </select>
        </p>

        <button type="submit">Save Data</button>
        
    </form>

> `post` method packages the data in the form and sends it to the web server.  
> `action` specifies where to send the data. (this will be linked to the Flask code to deal with the data that arrives from the form).  
> Without `<form>` tags nothing will look any different, but saving data won't work.  
> `hidden` is useful when you have some information that is relevant to the form or back end processing (like user ID), but that the user doesn't necessarily need to see.  
> `required` attribute inside an input tag makes it so that the user can't leave it blank.  
> `<select>` tag creates a drop-down menu, with each option surrounded by an `<option>` tag.  
> Within each `option` tag, `value` tells the form how to identify and store the choice.

## Flask  
- In order to associate `app.route()` to the HTML `form` tag I need to create a route for this page to receive the data.  
- Remember to `import request`.  
- Add the extra argument `methods = ["POST]` to specify the method being received.  
- Define the `process()` subroutine that returns `request.form`.  
- To get access to the contents of the form, we use `request`.  
- `request.form` returns a dictionary which we store in the `form` variable.  

        from flask import Flask, request

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route("/process", methods=["POST"])
        def process():
          page = ""
          form = request.form
          if form["baldies"] == "david":
            page += f"You're alright {form['username']}"
          else:
            page += f"You've picked wrong {form['username']}"
          return page

          
        @app.route('/')
        def index():
          page = """<form method = "post" action="/process">
            <p>Name: <input type="text" name="username" required> </p>
            <p>Email: <input type="Email" name="email"> </p>
            <p>Website: <input type="url" name="website"> </p>
            <p>Age: <input type="number" name="age"> </p>
            <input type="hidden" name="userID" value="232"> </p>

            <p>
              Fave Baldy: 
              <select name="baldies">
                <option>David</option>
                <option>Jean Luc Picard</option>
                <option>Yul Brynner</option>
              </select>
            </p>

            <button type="submit">Save Data</button>
          </form>
            
            
            """
          return page
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=81)

## Syntax  
- Made up of a series of instructions in `<tags>` that surround text/image filenames, etc. and influence how they are displayed on screen.  
- The `<head>` tags contain a lot of invisible information about the page that you won't see on screen.  
- This includes how to display your webpage on different devices (desktop vs. mobile device) as well as keywords.  
- The tag that we really care about inside head is the `<title>` tag. You do sort of see this on screen. It's the text that goes in the tab of the web page.  
- Also notice the indentation. This doesn't affect the way the code works like it does in Python, but it is standard practice to show how some tags are inside others. It also makes the code much easier to read.  
- The `href` argument specifies the location of the webpage being linked. It's short for 'hypertext reference'.  
- To link an image, surround the `<img>` tags with `<a>` tags.  

---

# CSS  
- Before CSS web coders had to individually tell each element how to look.  
-  CSS lets us create default settings & formats and apply them to parts of our page.  
- It's a bit like having formatting subroutines that you can call at any time.  

---

# Flask  
- Flask lets us build our own web-server. This means that it runs all of the time, creating the pages for your entire website.  
- The reason Flask is different from just using HTML/CSS is that it can be used to build dynamic web apps that change depending on the user.  
- A web server works slightly differently. We make one web server, click run, and give the website address to anyone who wants to use the program. This means that we can make our code private if we want.

HTML & CSS

LEARN HTML BY BUILDING A CAT PHOTO APP
●	Opening and closing tags
●	<!-- are for comments in HTML –>
●	Both img, input, meta and link elements are self-closing
●	The section element separates the different pieces of content from one another.
●	The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.
●	Nesting an input element inside a label element is an assistive element that makes selecting the text the same as selecting the radio button
●	The id attribute is used to identify specific HTML elements. Each id attribute's value must be unique from all other id values for the entire page.
●	Set the name attribute to the same value for all radio buttons to ensure selecting one deselects the other
●	You won't notice the name attribute of the input element in your browser. It makes it easier for a server to process your web form, especially when there are many
●	In order to make a checkbox checked or radio button selected by default, you need to add the checked attribute to it.
●	The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. Fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
●	A web form is used to collect information from users.
●	All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.
●	Meta tags are basic elements of search engine optimization used to describe page contents.
●	The lang attribute set to “en” in the opening html tag specifies that the language of the page is English.

LEARNS BASIC CSS BY BUILDING A CAFE MENU
●	The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines and how the page gets displayed.
●	The meta element with attribute charset set to value “utf-8” tells the browser how to encode characters for the page. Tells the browser to encode multiple languages.
○	utf-8 is a universal character set that includes almost every character from all human languages.
●	The meta element with the name attribute set to “viewport” ensures the page looks the same on all devices.
○	Ensures visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO..
●	The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes.
●	/* are for comments in CSS */
●	Type selectors vs class selectors(start with a .)
●	Article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.
●	You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.
●	To identify links that have been clicked, use a pseudo-selector 
○	Change color of clicked link a:selected{color: grey;}
○	Change color when hovering over link a:hover{color: brown;}
○	Change color of link being clicked a:active{color: white;}
●	To make an image (which are similar to inline elements) behave like heading elements (which are block-level), create an img type selector and use the value block for the display property

LEARN CSS COLORS BY BUILDING A SET OF COLORED MARKERS
●	When the margin property has two values, it sets margin-top and margin-bottom to the first value, and margin-left and margin-right to the second value.
○	E.g. margin: 10px auto;
●	There are two main color models: the additive RGB (red, green, blue) model used in electronic devices, and the subtractive CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model used in print.
○	Additive RGB means that colors begin as black, and change as different levels of red, green, and blue are introduced.
○	The CSS rgb function accepts values, or arguments, for red, green, and blue, and produces a color - rgb(red, green, blue)
○	Each red, green, and blue value is a number from 0 to 255. 0 means that there's 0% of that color, and is black. 255 means that there's 100% of that color.
●	Complementary colors - on opposite side of the color wheel produce gray if combined
●	Hex (hexadecimal) color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue. For example, #4B5320.
○	Hexadecimal, or base 16 values, go from 0 - 9, then A - F
○	0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
○	With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).
○	You can also add an alpha/opacity channel at the end using two digits.
●	The HSLA color model, or hue, saturation,lightness and alpha (opacity), is another way to represent colors. For example, hsl(240,100%,50%,0.8) is blue with 80% opacity
○	Accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.
○	The hue red is at 0 degrees, green is at 120 degrees, and blue is at 240 degrees.
○	Saturation is the intensity of a color from 0%, or gray, to 100% for pure color.
○	Lightness is how bright a color appears, from 0%, or complete black, to 100%, complete white, with 50% being neutral.
●	A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
○	The linear-gradient function actually creates an image element, and is usually paired with the background property which can accept an image as a value.
○	linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
○	Example: background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255,0,0), rgb(0,255,0);
■	gradientDirection is 180deg by default
○	gradientDirection is the direction of the line used for the transition. 
○	color1 and color2 are color arguments to be used in the transition itself.
○	Placing color stops after the defined color specifies at which point the color stops and the next begins. Example linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255,0,0) 75%, green;
●	The rgba function works just like the rgb function, but takes one more number from 0/0% to 1.0/100% for the alpha (opacity) channel:
●	The default display property for div elements is block. 
○	When two block elements are next to each other, they stack like actual blocks. 
○	To position two div elements on the same line, set their display properties to inline-block.
●	Instead of setting the parameters border-left-width, border-left-style, and border-left-color
○	You can use border-left: width style color;
○	Example: border-left: 10px solid black;
●	To add a slight shadow to each marker use the box-shadow - lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:
○	box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;
■	blurRadius (the blur of the shadow) and spreadRadius (the spread of the shadow) default to zero if not set
○	Example: box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px red;

LEARN HTML FORMS BY BUILDING A REGISTRATION FORM
●	As label elements are inline by default. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element.
●	For input elements specifying the type as “email” only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The “password” type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS.
○	Adding the attribute minlength=”8” to the input element for the password type prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted
○	Instead of the above you can set the pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match, for example: pattern = “[a-z0-5]{8,}”
■	This is a regular expression that matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5.
○	If you want to allow a user to upload a file, set the attribute type=”file”.
○	Within the input element if you set type=”number” you can then set the attributes  for min and max in order to define an acceptable range.
●	Use the select element to add a dropdown to a form. 
○	The select element is a container for a group of option elements
○	The option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
■	In order to submit useful info to the server based on options selected by users, set the value attribute to a number for each different text option
●	The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of rows and cols (columns).
○	Use the placeholder attribute, which accepts a text value that is displayed until the user starts typing.
●	You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class
○	p:last-of-type { }
○	That will select the last p element.
●	Use an attribute selector to select an element based on the given attribute value. Here is an example:
○	input[name="password"] { }
○	The above selects input elements with a name attribute value of password.
●	The style property margin: top right bottom left
○	Example: {margin: 20px auto;}
■	The first element is top and bottom, the second is left and right margin
●	The style property padding: top right bottom left

LEARN THE CSS BOX MODEL BY BUILDING  ROTHKO PAINTING
●	In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
○	The content is the item in the box, in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.
●	The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
●	Margin is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
○	Use margins to adjust the spacing outside of an element.
●	Before you can start styling your HTML, you need to link your CSS to your HTML.
●	Example: .class {width: 500px} - px stands for pixels
○	When sizing (width and height) you can also use % instead of px
















●	If you add padding to an element you change it’s width and height
○	Example: a box with width: 500px and height: 600px where padding is set to 1px becomes width: 502px and height: 602px
○	This makes sense as the inner box appears to be smaller, where in fact the outer box has just grown marginally
●	Setting overflow: hidden does a similar job to padding but doesn’t change width and height
●	Setting margin: auto will center your element
●	Use filter: blur(1px); to blur an image
●	Use blur the edges of a box use:
○	box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color
●	To round the corners of a box by 9 pixels:
○	{border-radius: 9px}

LEARN CSS FLEXBOX BY BUILDING A PHOTO GALLERY
●	To capitalize text:
○	text-transform: uppercase;
●	Normalize a box model with:
○	* {box-sizing: border-box;}
■	The borders you add won’t add any additional size to your elements
○	By default, the browser includes the border and padding when determining an element's size.
○	To solve this, reset the box model using the above code.
●	Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout that can control the way items are spaced out and aligned within a container. To use it:
○	{display: flex;}
○	This will make the element a flex container. Any direct children of a flex container are called flex items.
●	Flexbox has a main and cross axis. The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, which has four possible values (row, row-reverse, column & column-reverse)
●	The align-items property positions the flex content along the cross axis. 
○	If your flex-direction is set to row, your cross axis would be vertical.
○	To vertically center your images set {align-items: center;}
●	The flex-wrap property determines how your flex items behave when the flex container is too small. 
○	Setting it to wrap will allow the items to wrap to the next row or column. nowrap (default) will prevent your items from wrapping and shrink them if needed.
●	The justify-content property determines how the items inside a flex container are positioned along the main axis, affecting their position and the space around them.
○	{justify-content: center;}
●	To set consistent aspect ratios for your images (and avoid distortion)
○	{object-fit: cover;}
○	This will tell the image to fill the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit.
●	The gap shorthand sets gaps between rows and columns and can be used for flex, grid, and multi-column layouts:
○	Example: {gap: 16px} 
■	Creates some space between images for example.
○	row-gap and column-gap can also be used
●	The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. 
○	Example .gallery::after {content:””; width: 350px;} 
■	Adds an empty element after the last image. If we give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. Right now, it is in the center because we set justify-content: center on the flex container.
●	The alt image attribute is used if the image can't be loaded - this text is presented in place of the image.

LEARN TYPOGRAPHY BY BUILDING A NUTRITION LABEL
●	When setting the font-family, you can set a fallback font as the second argument
○	Example {font-family: “Open Sans”, sans-serif;}
■	N.B. fonts with spaces in the name must be wrapped in quotation marks
●	To change the font-weight (and make it more/less bold)
○	Example: {font-weight: 800;}
●	Use letter-spacing to set space between your letters
○	Example {letter-spacing: 0.15px;}
●	The float property is used to place an element on the left or right of its container, allowing other content (such as text) to wrap around it.
○	Example: {float: right;}
●	The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.
○	Example: if you set html to have a font-size of 16px, then setting some other element font-size to 0.85rem would calculate to be roughly 13.6px
●	If your element is overflowing into another element use:
○	{overflow: hidden;}
●	To clear the float property and push a divider and any following content down below the float text, use:
○	{clear: right;}
●	The :not pseudo-selector can be used to select all elements that do not match the given CSS rule.
○	Example: div:not(#example) {color: red;}
■	The above selects all div elements without an id of example.




LEARN ACCESSIBILITY BY BUILDING A QUIZ
●	The meta element with name set to “description” helps with accessibility and SEO. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
●	The header element is used to introduce the page as well as provide a navigation menu
●	The main element contains the core content of your page.
●	Images can be of type SVG. A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.
●	You can target an element within an element:
○	Example: target an unordered list element within the nav element
■	nav>ul { }
●	You can semantically separate the content within the form using section elements.
●	The form element accepts the method attribute
○	This specifies how to send the form data to the page specified in the action attribute
○	If set to post this is an HTTP post-transaction
■	Data is not shown in URL, good for sensitive data
●	The role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. 
○	Increases the page accessibility, 
○	The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.
○	Every role requires a visible label, which should be referenced by the aria-labelledby attribute.
●	To be able to navigate within a page, give each anchor/a element an href corresponding to the id of the element you want to navigate to, but append a # to the id
○	Example: href=”#student-info” will navigate to the element whose id=”student-info”
○	To make scrolling smooth, instead of jumping:
■	Example: * {scroll-behavior: smooth}
●	Within a fieldset element the legend element represents a caption for the content of its parent fieldset element
●	When nesting an input element inside a label element, although not required, it is best-practice to explicitly link a label (using the for attribute) with its corresponding input element (using the id attribute).
●	Use a pseudo element to prevent unnecessary repetition
○	Example p::before {content: “Question #”}
■	Adds the text “Question #” at the start of all p elements
●	For a dropdown menu using select and a nested option element, placing the keyword required in the select element makes this dropdown a required selection by the user
●	The footer element is a container for a collection of content that is related to the page, and the address element is a container for contact information for the author of the page.
●	When writing text to move to the next line, use:
○	<br />
●	In CSS when you want to select a nested element, do the following:
○	Given the nested sequence: nav, ul, li, a - in order to select a:
■	nav>ul>li>a OR
■	li>a OR
■	ul a OR
■	nav a
●	Certain types of motion-based animations can cause discomfort for some users. In particular, people with vestibular disorders have sensitivity to certain motion triggers.
○	The @media at-rule has a media feature called prefers-reduced-motion to set CSS based on the user's preferences. It can take one of the following values:
■	Reduce; or
■	No-preference
○	@media (feature: value) {
  		selector {
   styles
 }
}
●	To set a smooth scroll-behavior:
○	@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
* {
scroll-behavior: smooth;
 }
}

TRIBUTE PAGE
●	When using the link element ‘a’, setting the attribute target=”_blank” ensures the link opens in a new tab

LEARN MORE ABOUT CSS PSEUDO SELECTORS BY BUILDING A BALANCE SHEET
●	If you want a particular element to be hidden from screen readers, give it the aria-hidden attribute set to true.
●	HTML tables use the caption element to describe what the table element is about. 
○	The caption element should always be the first child of a table, but can be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.
●	The thead and tbody elements are used to indicate which portion of your table is the header, and which portion contains the primary data or content.
○	The tr element is used to indicate a table row.
■	The th element indicates a header cell, while a td element indicates a data cell.
■	Each td or th element indicates a separate column
●	You can use CSS to make elements completely hidden from the visual page, but still be announced by screen readers.

○	Example: span[class~="sr-only"] 
■	This will select any span element whose class includes sr-only.
○	The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. 
■	Set the clip property to rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px).
○	The clip-path and -webkit-clip-path properties determine the shape the clip property should take.
■	Set both to the value of inset(50%), forming the clip-path into a rectangle within the element.
○	Taking the hidden elements out of the document flow will ensure that not only are they no longer visible, but they are not even within the page view.
■	Set the position property to absolute
●	Within a flex container: 
○	Setting the flex-direction property to column-reverse will display the nested elements from bottom to top.
○	The gap property, set to 1rem, creates some space between the elements.
○	An element with position property set to sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
■	A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
■	Setting top: 0 then fixes the element to the top of its container
●	The :first-of-type pseudo-selector is used to target the first element that matches the selector. 
○	To select the first span element within the flex class, do the following:
■	.flex span:first-of-type{ }
●	Where id=”firstname” you can use #firstname in CSS to select the element
●	The calc() function allows you to perform calculations to determine CSS property values
●	In CSS the span[class] syntax will target any span element that has a class attribute set, regardless of the attribute's value.
●	The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector
○	Example span:not(.sr-only)
■	In this case, any of the span elements that do not have the sr-only class.
●	You can use the !important keyword to ensure properties are always applied, regardless of order or specificity rather than having to constantly double-check you are not overwriting your earlier properties
○	Example:
■	span[class~="sr-only"] {
  border: 0 !important;
●	Setting the border-collapse property to collapse allows the cell borders to collapse into a single border, instead of a border around each cell.
●	To fix the width of the viewport, set both min-width and max-width to the same value in CSS.
●	The key difference between tr[class="total"] th and tr.total th is that the first will select th elements where the only class for tr is total. The second will select th elements where the class for tr includes total.
●	The :nth-of-type() pseudo-selector is used to target specific elements based on their order among siblings of the same type. 
○	Example: tr.total td:nth-of-type(3) {
  padding-right: 0.5rem;
}
■	Targets the third td element within the total class table rows.
●	To create a hover effect:
○	Example tr.total:hover {background-color: #99c9ff; }
■	When you hover over the specified text the background color changes
●	Use vertical-align: top to vertically align text in CSS

LEARN INTERMEDIATE CSS BY BUILDING A PICASSO PAINTING
●	Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position property.
○	An absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and allows you to adjust it relative to its container.
○	When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top, left, right, and bottom.
■	E.g. top: 20%;
●	The z-index property is used to create "layers" for your HTML elements. 
○	Elements with a higher z-index value will appear to be layered on top of elements with a lower z-index value. This can be combined with the positioning element.
○	Example: z-index: -1;
■	Will make the element appear "behind" the other elements.
●	The i element is used for idiomatic text, or text that is separate from the "normal" text content. This could be for italic text, such as scientific terms, or for icons like those provided by FontAwesome.
●	Other semantic text elements:
○	<em> (emphasized text)
○	<strong> (important text)
○	<mark> (marked/highlighted text)
○	<cite> (the title of a work)
○	<dfn> (a definition term)

LEARN RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN BY BUILDING A PIANO
●	In order to pass a rule from the parent element to the child use the inherit keyword
○	E.g. if you set html {box-sizing: border-box;}
○	Then set *, *::before, *::after {box-sizing: inherit;}
■	This tells the targeted elements to use the same value as the parent element.
■	You need to target the pseudo-elements specifically, which are the special keywords that follow a selector.
●	The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often used to create cosmetic content.
●	If you set one element’s position to absolute and you want it to be relative to another element, then the other element’s position must be set to relative - as the first element needs a point of reference.
●	The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally apply CSS. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties.
○	@media (max-width: 768px) {
 	 #piano {
    width: 358px;
  }
}
■	Width of 358px is applied to the piano ID when the viewport is 768px and below
○	The above rule is used so that your application is appropriately viewed on different types of screens
○	This code is often used in conjunction with overflow: hidden
■	This property will hide any element that is pushed outside the set width
●	Logical operators can be used to construct more complex media queries. The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.
@media (max-width: 1199px) and (min-width: 769px) {
  #piano {
    width: 675px;
  }
}
■	This rule applies if the browser window is wider than 769px but smaller than 1199px.

TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION PAGE
●	Use line-height to space lines
●	Use overflow-y: auto to add a scroll bar for overflowing boxes
●	Use text-decoration to specify the decoration added/removed from text

LEARN CSS VARIABLES BY BUILDING A CITY SKYLINE
●	<!DOCTYPE html> is used so the browser knows what type of document it is reading
●	To add a border to your page:
○	* {border: 1px solid black; }
■	Use an asterisk to target everything
■	This is a trick to help visualize where elements are (and their size) and can be removed later
●	Using box-sizing: border-box; ensures that any border you add doesn't add any size to your elements.
●	Variable declarations begin with two dashes (--) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;
○	Example: --building-color1: grey;
○	If you want to use that variable later on:
■	background-color: var(--building-color1, green);
●	This will set the background color to grey
●	We set the fallback color to green in the event there is a problem with the variable
○	The main advantage of using variables is to be able to quickly change many values in your stylesheet by just changing the value of a variable.
●	Variables are often declared in the :root selector. This is the highest level selector in CSS; putting your variables there will make them usable everywhere.
●	Flex-direction sets the main axis
●	Align-items will align items along the cross axis
●	Justify-content aligns items along the main axis
●	align-items: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_align-items.asp
●	justify-content: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp
●	Relative position is the norm, fixed position means the element does not move when scrolling, sticky position toggles between first being relative and then becoming fixed when scrolling, absolute position means the element can be positioned manually and is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
●	position: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
●	Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property
○	Example: background: linear-gradient(color1,color2,color3…)
●	repeating-linear-gradient - makes the colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to the bottom of the element (giving you a stripe effect)
●	radial-gradient - creates a circular gradient

LEARN CSS GRID BY BUILDING A MAGAZINE
●	The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the user scrolls the image into view).
○	As an additional benefit, lazy loaded elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page without having to wait for the images to load.
●	You can add a width and height attribute to an img element in HTML in order to set the dimensions of the image (this can also be done in CSS)
●	Wrapping the text of a p element in an a element
○	<p class="author-name">By <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a></p>
●	The Referer HTTP header contains information about the address or URL of a page that a user might be visiting from. This information can be used in analytics to track how many users from your page visit a certain site. Setting the rel attribute to noreferrer omits this information from the HTTP request.
●	You can use an hr element to display a divider between sections of different content.
●	The blockquote element specifies a section that is quoted from another source.
○	Browsers usually indent blockquote elements
●	Article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.
●	The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to the content around the aside element. Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
●	Setting the html font-size property to 62.5% will create text of size 10px (as the browser default is 16px).
○	Subsequently, if you set other text to 2rem, this equates to 20px (as the html is set to 10px).
●	CSS Grid offers a two-dimensional grid-based layout, allowing you to center items horizontally and vertically while still retaining control to do things like overlap elements.
○	Do this by setting the display property set to grid.
●	CSS Grid is similar to Flexbox in that it has a special property for both the parent and child elements.
●	Example: grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr;
○	Creates three columns where the middle column is 94rem wide, and the first and last columns are both 1 fraction of the remaining space in the grid container.
●	Use the minmax function to make your columns responsive on any device. The minmax function takes two arguments, the first being the minimum value and the second being the maximum. These values could be a length, percentage, fr, or even a keyword like max-content.
○	grid-template-columns: 
 	 minmax(2rem,1fr) 
 	 minmax(min-content,94rem)
 minmax(2rem,1fr);
●	You already set the overall layout in the main rule, but you can adjust the placement in the child rules.
○	One option is the grid-column property, which is shorthand for grid-column-start and grid-column-end. The grid-column property tells the grid item which grid line to start and end at.
○	Example: grid-column: 2 / 3; 
■	This tells the element to start in column 2 and end on column line 3.
■	Note: the total number of columns available has been specified in the parent element with grid-template-columns: 1fr 94rem 1fr (in this case there are three columns)
●	The CSS repeat() function is used to repeat a value, rather than writing it out manually, and is helpful for grid layouts. 
○	For example, setting the grid-template-columns property to repeat(20, 200px) would create 20 columns each 200px wide.
●	For the grid-column element there may be times where you are unsure of how many columns your grid will have, but you want an element to stop at the last column. To do this, you can use -1 for the end column.
●	Create an img selector and give it a width property set to 100%, and an object-fit property set to cover.
●	Setting the object-fit property, applied to an img element, to cover, tells the browser how to position the element within its container. In this case, cover will set the image to fill the container, cropping as needed to avoid changing the aspect ratio.
●	Using the hover effect:
○	Example: .author-name a:hover {background-color: #306203}
○	This will create a hover effect only for the a element within the .author-name.
●	As an alternative to grid-template-columns you can use the grid-auto-flow property.
○	This property takes either row or column as the first value, with an optional second value of dense. 
○	Uses an auto-placement algorithm to adjust the grid layout. 
○	Setting it to column will tell the algorithm to create new columns for content as needed. The default for new column width will be auto.
○	To override this set grid-auto-columns to another value, such as 1fr.
○	The dense value allows the algorithm to backtrack and fill holes in the grid with smaller items, which can result in items appearing out of order.
●	Much like Flexbox, with CSS Grid you can align the content of grid items with align-items and justify-items. 
○	align-items will align child elements along the column axis;
○	justify-items will align child elements along the row axis.
●	Use letter-spacing to space out your letters
●	An alternative for creating columns, without using CSS Grid, is to use the column-width property.
○	If a column is 50rem in width, setting column-width to 25rem will create two columns. If the column was 75rem then this would create three columns.
●	To justify text, set text-align: justify;
●	The ::first-letter pseudo-selector allows you to target the first letter in the text content of an element.
○	E.g. first-paragraph::first-letter {font-size: 6rem}
●	You can add quotation marks with CSS pseudo selectors.
○	If you have a class called quote, create:
■	.quote::before {content: ‘ “ ’;}
■	.quote::after {content: ‘ “ ‘;}
●	Use the column-gap property to provide more spacing between columns.
●	Use the list-style-type property set to none to get rid of the bullet points on the list items.
●	With grid-template-rows set to repeat(3, min-content)
○	This provides grid rows that adjust in height based on the content
●	The gap property is a shorthand way to set the value of column-gap and row-gap at the same time. 
○	If given one value, it sets the column-gap and row-gap both to that value. If given two values, it sets the row-gap to the first value and the column-gap to the second.
●	The place-items property can be used to set the align-items and justify-items values at the same time. 
○	The place-items property takes one or two values. If one value is provided, it is used for both the align-items and justify-items properties. If two values are provided, the first value is used for the align-items property and the second value is used for the justify-items property.
●	If, for example, you have a two column layout and you want an element to span both columns
○	Example: .image-1 {grid-column: 1 / -1}
●	In order to collapse columns (and make your webpage responsive on smaller devices):
@media only screen and (max-width:720px) {
  .image-wrapper {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
○	This will collapse the three images into one column on smaller screens.

BUILD A PRODUCT LANDING PAGE
●	To capitalize text using CSS:
○	text-transform: uppercase;
●	To change cursor to a pointer when hovering over a button use:
○	cursor: pointer;
●	To upload video using iframe
○	Example: <iframe id="video" height="315"      src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y8Yv4pnO7qc?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-dashlane-frameid="4144"></iframe>
●	To shift a container to the left of the element, use:
○	justify-content: flex-end;

LEARN CSS ANIMATION BY BUILDING A FERRIS WHEEL
●	The transform-origin property is used to set the point around which a CSS transformation is applied. 
○	For example, when performing a rotate, the transform-origin determines around which point the element is rotated.
○	E.g. transform-origin: 0% 0%;
■	This will offset the origin point by 0% from the left and 0% from the top, setting it to the top left corner of the element.
●	The :nth-of-type() pseudo-selector is used to target specific elements based on their order among siblings of the same type.
●	The transform property allows you to manipulate the shape of an element.
○	E.g. transform: rotate(60deg);
■	Will rotate the element around its transform-origin point by 60 degrees clockwise.
●	The @keyframes rule is used to define the flow of a CSS animation. Within the @keyframes rule, you can create selectors for specific points in the animation sequence, such as 0% or 25%, or use from and to to define the start and end of the sequence.
●	@keyframes wheel {
   0% {
     transform: rotate(0deg);
   }
  100% {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}
○	The 0% selector is how the animation should start i.e. stationery at 0deg
○	The 100% selector is how the animation should end i.e. full rotation
●	The animation-name property is used to link a @keyframes rule to a CSS selector. The value of this property should match the name of the @keyframes rule.
●	The animation-duration property is used to set how long the animation should take to complete. The time should be specified in either seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
●	The animation-timing-function property sets how the animation should progress over time. There are a few different values for this property. If you want your animation to run at the same rate from start to finish set this to linear.
●	The animation-iteration-count property sets how many times your animation should repeat. This can be set to a number, or to infinite to indefinitely repeat the animation.
●	You can use the animation property to set these all at once.
○	E.g. animation: cabins 10s linear infinite;
○	This will set the animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, and animation-iteration-count properties in that order.

LEARN CSS TRANSFORMS BY BUILDING A PENGUIN
●	vh stands for viewport height. Represents a percentage of the height of the browser default viewport size. 
○	1vw is 1% of the viewport width. 
○	For example, if the viewport height is 300px , then a value of 50vh on an element will be 150px
○	Similarly vw is viewport width
●	To skew an object use the skew transform function, which takes two arguments. The first being an angle to shear the x-axis by, and the second being an angle to shear the y-axis by.
○	E.g. transform: skew(0deg, 44deg);
●	Syntax for the font property
○	font: font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size/line-height, font-family
○	E.g. font: italic small-caps bold 12px/30px Georgia, serif;
●	.penguin:active {
  transform: scale(1.5);
  cursor: not-allowed;
○	The active property creates rules for when you click an element
○	The scale function increases the size of the element when clicked
○	The cursor: not-allowed property creates a do-not-allow symbol when the element is clicked
●	 transition: transform 1s ease-in-out 0ms;
○	The transition function dictates how the element functions when it is clicked or hovered over
○	In this case, when the penguin is clicked its scale is increased by 1.5, but the transition means that this increase takes 1 second, has a slow start and end, and a 0ms delay
○	To create a transition effect, you must specify at least two things:
■	The CSS property you want to add an effect to
●	In this case we are performing a transition on the transform property
●	When the penguin is clicked it is scaled to x1.5 - however the transition function dictates how the penguin is scaled
■	The duration of the effect

PERSONAL PORTFOLIO WEBPAGE
●	Use the color property to change text color
●	Use justify-content: space-evenly to space elements
●	To move an element vertically down when the mouse hovers over it, use:
○	.contact-details:hover {
  transform: translateY(8px);
}
●	Use translateX to move the element horizontally
●	Use the box-shadow to apply a shadow around an element.
○	box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;
■	blurRadius (the blur of the shadow) and spreadRadius (the spread of the shadow) default to zero if not set
○	Example: box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px 5px red;
●	When using the link element a, setting the attribute target=”_blank” ensures the link opens in a new tab
●	The alt image attribute is used if the image can't be loaded - this text is presented in place of the image.
