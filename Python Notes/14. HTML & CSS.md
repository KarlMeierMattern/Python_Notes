## Syntax  
- Made up of a series of instructions in `<tags>` that surround text/image filenames, etc. and influence how they are displayed on screen.  
- The `<head>` tags contain a lot of invisible information about the page that you won't see on screen.  
- This includes how to display your webpage on different devices (desktop vs. mobile device) as well as keywords.  
- The tag that we really care about inside head is the `<title>` tag. You do sort of see this on screen. It's the text that goes in the tab of the web page.  
- Also notice the indentation. This doesn't affect the way the code works like it does in Python, but it is standard practice to show how some tags are inside others. It also makes the code much easier to read.  
- The `href` argument specifies the location of the webpage being linked. It's short for 'hypertext reference'.  
- To link an image, surround the `<img>` tags with `<a>` tags.

# CSS  
- Before CSS web coders had to individually tell each element how to look.  
-  CSS lets us create default settings & formats and apply them to parts of our page.  
- It's a bit like having formatting subroutines that you can call at any time.

# Flask  
- Flask lets us build our own web-server. This means that it runs all of the time, creating the pages for your entire website.  
- The reason Flask is different from just using HTML/CSS is that it can be used to build dynamic web apps that change depending on the user.  
- A web server works slightly differently. We make one web server, click run, and give the website address to anyone who wants to use the program. This means that we can make our code private if we want.
