INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS IN PYTHON

1. Summary Statistics

1.1 What is statistics?
●	Descriptive (current state) vs inferential stats
●	Numeric (quantitative) data:
○	Continuous (measured e.g. time, speed)
○	Discrete data (counted e.g. number of pets)
●	Categorical (qualitative) data
○	Nominal (unordered) e.g. married vs unmarried
○	Ordinal (ordered) e.g. survey question indicating degree to which you agree


1.2 Measures of center
●	np.mean()
●	np.median()
●	statistics.mode() - import statistics first
●	Skewed data: the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew
○	Left skewed data (long left tail)
○	This can impact the reliability of the mean

Example
# Subset for Belgium and USA only in the food_consumption DataFrame
be_and_usa = food_consumption[(food_consumption['country'] == "Belgium") | (food_consumption['country'] == 'USA')]

# Group by country, select consumption column, and compute mean and median
print(be_and_usa.groupby('country')['consumption'].agg([np.mean, np.median]))



1.3 Measures of spread
●	A quartile is one type of quantile

Example
# Calculate the quartiles of co2_emission
# np.linspace shows the 5 quantiles that splits the data up into 4 parts
print(np.quantile(food_consumption['co2_emission'], np.linspace(0,1,5))


2. Random numbers and probability
