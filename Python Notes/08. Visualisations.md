# Visualisations  

## Matplotlib  

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
        plt.plot(x,y)
        plt.xlabel(‘x label’)  
        plt.ylabel(‘y label’)
        plt.title(‘title’)
        plt.yticks([0,2,4,6,8])
        plt.show()          

## Visualisations  
`dog_pack[‘height_cm’].hist(bins = 20)` creates a histogram with 20 bins of the height data.  
`avg_weight_by_breed.plot(kind = ‘bar’, title = ‘Bar plot’)` creates a bar graph of the data (dog breed vs weight) with the title “Bar plot”.  
`sully.plot(x = ‘date’, y = ‘weight_kg’, kind = ‘line’, rot = 45)` creates a line plot of (years vs weight) and rotates the x labels by 45 degrees.  
`dog_pack.plot(x = height_cm, y = ‘weight_kg’, kind = scatter)` scatter plot of (height vs weight) of dogs.  

## Plotting two plots on top of one another  
- Use alpha for transparency.  

        dog_pack[dog_pack[‘sex’] == ‘F’][‘height_cm'].hist(alpha = 0.7)
        dog_pack[dog_pack[‘sex’] == ‘M’][‘height_cm'].hist(alpha = 0.7)
        plt.legend([‘F’, ‘M’])	
        plt.show()

---

## Matplotlib vs Pandas functionality  

        ax = plt.axes()
        ax.hist(data.petal_length, bins=25);

> Using Matplotlib's plotting functionality.  

        ax = data.petal_length.hist(bins=25)

> Using Pandas plotting functionality.  
> Often easier to use than Matplotlib.  

---

## Subplots  
- `.subplots()` are part of the matplotlib library.  
- Multiple small plots that show similar data across different conditions e.g. precipitation data across different cities.  

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()

> Adding data to a figure is done by calling methods of the Axes object.  
> When called without any inputs `.subplots()` creates two objects: 1. `fig` - figure, holds everything we see 2. `ax` - axes, holds the data.  

        ax.plot(seattle_weather[“MONTH”], seattle_weather[“MLY-TAVG-NORMAL”])

> This is a plotting command, which is a method of the axis object.  
> The first argument is the x coordinate and the second is the y coordinate.  
> `Ax` is the object and `.plot` is the method.  

## Arguments for ax.plot() function  
`marker = ‘o’` adds a marker shaped like an ‘o’ for x,y coordinates on the graph.  
`linestyle = ‘--’` changes the line style to ‘--’.  
`linestyle = ‘none’` eliminates the line and only shows the markers.  
`color = ‘r’` changes the color of the markers and line to red.    
`ax.set(xlabel='Time', ylabel='Average temperature', title='Weather in Seattle')` sets x label, y label and title.  
`ax.tick_params(‘y’, colors = ‘blue’)` changes the color of the ticks and tick marks on the y axis.  
`ax.annotate(“>1 degree”, xy = (pd.TimeStamp(‘2015-10-06’), 1), xytext = (pd.TimeStamp(‘2008-10-06’), -0.2), arrowprops = {“arrowstyle”: “->”, “color”:”gray”})` annotates the text at the coordiantes ‘2008-10-06’, but references the coordinates of ‘2015-10-06’, and changes the arrowstyle and arrow colors.  

        fig, ax = plt.subplots(3,2,sharey=True)
        ax[0,0].plot = (seattle_weather[“MONTH”], seattle_weather[“MLY-TAVG-NORMAL”])

> Adding data to a figure is done by calling methods of the Axes object.  
> Creates an array of subplots with 3 rows and 2 columns i.e. 6 subplots.  
> Sets the subplot at row 0, column 0.  
> `sharey=True` means both subplots will have the same range of y-axis values.  
> Even though we created the subplot as an array (3,2) the top left plot is at coordinates [0,0], the top right plot is at [0,1], bottom right [2,1] etc.  
> Exception: when the array is 1-dimensional i.e. `fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)` (2 rows and 1 column), when setting the subplot at [0,0] we just use [0] and similarly when setting the second row we just use [1].  

---

## Twinx  

        climate_change = pd.read_csv(“climate_change.csv”, parse_dates = True, index_col = 0)
        ax.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change[‘Co2’])
        ax2 = ax.twinx() - twin axes object
        ax2.plot(climate_change.index, climate_change[‘relative_temp’])

> `parse_dates=True` sets all dates to DateTime objects.  
> Setting `index_col=0` tells Python to treat the first column as the index.  
> Plots two sets of data with the same x-axis but with y-axes whose scale differs.  

---

## Stacked bar charts  

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.bar(medals.index, medals[“Gold”], label = “Gold)
        ax.bar(medals.index, medals[“Silver”], bottom = medals[“Gold”], label = “Silver”)
        ax.bar(medals.index, medals[“Bronze”], bottom = medals[“Gold”] + medals[“Silver”],label = “Bronze”) 
        ax.set_xticklabels(medals.index, rotation = 90)
        ax.legend()
        plt.show()

> Creates a stacked bar chart where gold medals are visually represented below the silver medals, which are below bronze.  
> Gold will be at the bottom given that it was defined first.  

## Histograms  
- Shows the number of observations (on the y-axis) within a particular ‘bin’ of values (on the x-axis).  

        ax.hist(mens_rowing[“Height”], label = “Rowing”, bins = 20, histtype = “step”)

> By default the number of bins is 10. Can also pass a list to bins = [10,20,30,40,50] which would be the boundaries between individual bins.  
> By default `histtype='bar'`, however if multiple histograms are plotted they can obscure each other. Setting `histtype='step'` will show the outlines of the bars.    

## Box plot  

        ax.boxplot([mens_rowing[“Height”], mens_gymnastics[“Height”]])
        ax.set_xticklables([“Rowing”, “Gymnastics”])

> Outputs two boxplots of height for rowing and gymnastics.  

## Scatter plots  
- Useful for bi-variate comparison i.e. comparing two variables (such as the relationship between height and weight).  

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.scatter(climate_change[“co2”], climate_change[“relative_temp”], c=climate_change.index)

> `climate_change.index` refers to the date column in this DataFrame. Setting `c=climate_change.index` displays different colors for different dates.  

## Plot styles  
`plt.style.use(“ggplot”)` plot style from the ggplot library
`plt.style.ust(“Solarize_Light2”)`  
`plt.style.use(“default”)` reverts back to the original style

## Saving your plot to a file  
`fig.savefig(“gold_medals.png”)` this file format provides lossless compression of image (high quality and large file size).  
`fig.savefig(“gold_medal.jpg”, quality = 50)` use .jpg for lossy compression if you want to use less space and lower quality. The argument quality takes in a number from 1 to 100 depending on the quality you desire. Avoid values>95 as the compression is no longer effective.  
`fig.savefig(“gold_medal.svg”)` produces a vector graphics file which can be edited by advanced graphics software.  
`fig.savefig(“gold_medals.png”,dpi = 300)` the dpi (dots-per-inch) argument refers to quality with which the image is rendered.  
`fig.set_size_inches([5,3])` 1st number sets width, 2nd number sets height. This determines the aspect ratio.  

---

## Seaborn  
- Data visualisation library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with Pandas data structures.  
- Must still use `plt.show()` to display visual.  

        %matplotlib inline  
        import seaborn as sns  
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Plot types  
`sns.jointplot(data=penguins, x="bill_length", y="bill_depth", hue="species", kind='reg')` scatter plot of bill length vs bill depth with a linear regression line fitted.  
`sns.scatterplot(x = height, y = weight, data=tips, hue='age')` hue adds color to the various x and y coordinates based on that persons age.  
`sns.countplot(y = [SA, US, SA, UK, UK, SA])` displays the region on the y-axis, while the x-axis displays a bar graph of the count/number in each region. You can either set the y or x axis depending on how you want the bars displayed i.e. horizontally (set y) or vertically (set x).  

## Styling  
`sns.set_style("darkgrid")`    

## Additional arguments  
`hue_order=[“Yes”, “No”]` assigns the order to the legend.  
`palette={“Yes”: “black”, “No”: “red”}` sets the colors for the hue.  

---

## Relationship plots  
- Used to show the relationship between two quantitative variables i.e. scatter plots and line plots.  
- `relplot()` offers more flexibility over `scatterplot()` so it is better to use.  

        sns.relplot(x=“total_bill”, y=“tips”, data=tips, kind=‘scatter’, col=‘smoker’, row=‘time’)

> `kind` can either be ‘scatter’ or ‘line’.  
> `col` produces two separate plots: one for smokers and one for non-smokers. Arranges the plots side-by-side.  
> `row` creates another two plots on the row below. Arranges the plots vertically.  

### Additional arguments  
`col_wrap=2` sets the maximum number of columns for subplots equal to 2 i.e. 2 columns of plots.  
`col_order=[ ]` pass a list of the order you want the plots to appear in.  
`size=“weights”` set the size of each point based on the weights column in the data set. 
`hue=“weights”` changes the colour of each point based on the weights column.  
`style=“smoker”` uses different point styles for each value of the variable i.e. yes and no are assigned different styles.  
`alpha=0.4` changes the transparency. 0 is completely transparent and 1 is fully transparent.  
`ci=“cd”` shows the shaded region around the plot as the standard deviation rather than the confidence level. This shows us the distribution of observations.  
`ci=None` turns off the shaded area.  
`markers=True` places markers on a line plot for each data point.  
`dashes=False` turns off dashed lines in a line plot.  

---

## Visualising a categorical and a quantitative variable  

Categorical plots
Categorical plots include: count plots, bar plots, box plots and point plots

catplot() - similar functionality to relplot() but used to plot the distribution of a quantitative variable by category. Supports making subplots

Use col and row parameters to add subplots, in addition to hue


Count plots
Previously:	sns.countplot(x = “how_masculine”, data =masculinity_data)
Now:		sns.catplot(x = “how_masculine”, data =masculinity_data, kind = ‘count’)

Additional arguments
order = [ ] - pass a list into this parameter to set the order you want the categories to appear on the plot


Bar plots
Bar plots show the mean of a quantitative variable per category.
By default Seaborn shows the 95% confidence level for these means, which show us the level of uncertainty.

sns.catplot(x = ‘day’, y = ‘total_bill’, data = tips, kind = ‘bar’)

Additional arguments
ci = None - turns off the confidence intervals

Note
When the y-variable is True/False, bar plots will show the percentage of responses reporting True. This plot shows us that males report a much higher interest in math compared to females.


Box plots
Useful for comparing categorical data (such as days of the week) across quantitative variables (such as total tips)

sns.catplot(x = ‘day’, y = ‘total_bill’, data = tips, kind = ‘box’)

Additional arguments
sym = “ ” - passing an empty string into this parameter will omit the outliers in the box plot.
whis = 2.0 - by default the whiskers are set to 1.5 * IQR (interquartile range = Q3 - Q1).
whis = [5, 95] - alternatively this will specify the lower whisker be drawn at the 5th percentile and the upper whisker at the 95th percentile.
whis = [0, 100] - places the whiskers at the min and max values.


Point plots
Shows the mean of a quantitative variable for each category as a point.
The confidence interval for the mean is drawn as a vertical line (95% confidence interval).

sns.catplot(x = “age”, y = “masculinity_important”, data = masculinity_data, hue = “feel_masculine”, kind = “point”)

Additional arguments
join = False - removes the joining lines between mean values
capsize = 0.2 - changes the size of the caps at the end of each confidence interval line
ci = None - turns off the confidence interval off and just shows the mean value

Displaying the median instead of the mean
from numpy import median
sns.catplot(x = “smoker”, y = “total_bill”, data = tips, kind = “point”, estimator = median) - instead of plotting the mean, setting the estimator argument to median plots the median values


4. Customising Seaborn plots

Changing plot style and color

sns.set_style(“whitegrid”) - changes the background to show a whitegrid. You can also pass in “dark”, “white”, “darkgrid” and “ticks” (adds tick marks to x and y axis)

sns.set_palette(“RdBu”) - this a scale of colours. 
Can also pass in:
Diverging palettes: “PRGn”, “RdBu_r”, “PRGn_r”; or
Sequential palettes: “Greys”, “Blues”, “PuRd”, “GnBu”, “Purples”

custom_palette = [“red”, “green”, “orange”]
sns.set_palette[custom_palette] - set your own custom palette


Changing the scale

sns.set_context() - changes the size of the scale. Pass in the arguments: “paper” (smallest - use in a paper session), “notebook” (use in an iPython Notebook), “talk” (use in a talk/presentation) or “poster” (largest - use in a poster session)


Adding titles and labels
Must first determine whether the plot is a FacetGrid and AxesSubplot.
relplot() and catplot() are FacetGrids (can create subplots) while scatterplot(), countplot(), boxplot() etc. are AxesSubplots (only creates a single plot)

Do this by setting:

g = sns.scatterplot(x = ‘height’, y = ‘weight’, data = df)
type(g) - determine the type of the plot. If it is a FacetGrid then use the code below.

For a FacetGrid type object:
g.fig.suptitle(“New Title”, y = 1.05) - the y parameter sets the height of the label. The default height is 1.

For an AxesSubplot type object:
g.fig.suptitle(“New Title”, y = 1.05) - setting the main title
g.set_title(“This is {col_name}”) - this will set each subplot title based on the name in the column

Axis labels (for both FacetGrid and AxesSubplot objects):
g.set(xlabel = “New x label”, ylabel = “New y label”)

To rotate labels (for both FacetGrid and AxesSubplot objects):
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)


INTERMEDIATE DATA VISUALIZATION WITH SEABORN

1. Seaborn introduction
Seaborn leverages Matplotlib and integrates with Pandas.
Built on Matplotlib and works best with Pandas’ DataFrames.
Has embedded functionality that makes visualizations look better.
Seaborn generally does more statistical analysis on data and can provide more sophisticated insight into the data.


Using the distribution plot

Matplotlib histogram
df[‘alcohol’].plot.hist()
plt.show()
plt.clf() - clears the plot

Seaborn version of a histogram
Gaussian Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) function
The KDE helps to smooth the distribution and is a useful way to look at the data.
sns.distplot(df[‘alcohol’])
plt.show()

Additional arguments (creates standard histogram without Seaborn extras)
sns.distplot(df[‘alcohol’], kde = False, bins = 10)
plt.show()

Additional arguments
kde = False - disables the KDE output and turns the KDE function into a standard histogram
hist = False - shows the outline of the histogram bars as a line, but omits the bars
rug = True - draws a rugplot on the x-axis (small vertical lines to show each observation in the distribution)
kde_kws = {‘shade’: True} - shades the plot by passing in the kde keywords dictionary


Regression plots
The previous analysis we have done is called univariate analysis as we only look at one variable.
Regression analysis is bivariate as we look for relationships between two variables

sns.regplot(x = ‘alcohol’, y = ‘pH’, data = df)
-	Must explicitly define x and y variables and source of the data. The x and y variables refer to the columns in the DataFrame - we don’t subset the DataFrame as we explicitly define the source of the data as one of the arguments.

regplot() vs lmplot()
Both produce similar results but the lmplot() is much more powerful

Additional arguments lmplot()
hue = ‘type’ - overlays two plots of different colors distinguished by type
col = ‘type’ - creates two separate plots (stacked horizontally) distinguished by type
row = ‘type’ - creates two separate plots (stacked vertically) distinguished by type

Note
Faceting: plotting multiple graphs while changing a single variable. Use the col or row argument to do this.



2. Customizing Seaborn plots

Setting styles
sns.set() - default Seaborn style applied to a chart
sns.set_style() - pass in either of the arguments ‘white’, dark’, ‘whitegrid’, ‘darkgrid’, ‘ticks’
sns.despine(left = True) - removes the y axis spine to make chart look cleaner


Colors
We are able to apply Matplotlib color codes

sns.set(color_codes = True)
# Matplotlib color codes can now be applied
sns.distplot(df[‘Tuition’], color = ‘g’)

sns.set_palette() - set the color palette. Can pass either of the arguments ‘deep’, ‘muted’, ‘pastel’, ‘bright’, ‘dark’, ‘colorblind’


Example to loop through multiple chart colors
for p in [‘deep’, ‘pastel’]:
	sns.set_palette(p)
	sns.distplot(df[‘fmr_3’])
	plt.show()


Palettes
Three types of palettes: sequential (continuous order), diverging (high vs low) and circular (no particular order to data)

sns.set_palette(“RdBu”) - this a scale of colours. 


Viewing palettes
Use sns.palplot() to view the palette when calling sns.color_palette

sns.palplot(sns.color_palette(“Blues”, 6) - contains 6 colors from the “Blues” palette 
plt.show() - shows the palettes


Customising with Matplotlib
Most of the time, you can use the Seaborn API to modify your visualizations but sometimes it is helpful to use matplotlib's functions to customize your plots. 
Available through Matplotlib’s axes objects.
Once you have an axes object, you can perform a lot of customization of your plot.


Example
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.distplot(df[‘Tuition’], ax = ax)
ax.set(xlabel = “Tuition 2013”, ylabel = “Distribution”, xlim = (0, 50000), title = “Tuition and fees”)
# xlim sets a limit range between $0 - $50,000


Example
fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(nrows = 1, ncols = 2, sharey = True, figsize = (7,4))
# sharey means the subplots will have the same range of y axis values
sns.distplot(df[‘Tuition’], ax = ax0)
# 1st plot
sns.distplot(df[‘Fees’], ax = ax1)
# 2nd plot
ax0.set(xlabel = “Tuition 2013”, ylabel = “Distribution”)
# sets the labels for ax0 
ax1.axvline(x = 20000, label = ‘My budget’, linestyle = ‘--’)
# draws a vertical line at x = 20000 on the ax1 plot
# could also set x = df[‘Fees’].mean() to show the mean
ax1.legend()
# turns on the legend for the axvline for the ax1 plot



3. Additional plot types

Categorical plot types
sns.stripplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’, jitter = True)
# plots each observation
sns.swarmplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’) 
# swarmplot does not scale well to large data sets
# plots each observation
sns.boxplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’)
sns.violinplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’)
# combination of the boxplot and KDE function
sns.lvplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’)
# the Letter Value plot is a hybrid between box and violin plot

Statistical summaries of categorical data
sns.barplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’, hue = ‘region’)
# shows the confidence interval
sns.pointplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, x = ‘average cover charge’, hue = ‘region’)
# shows the confidence interval
sns.countplot(data = df, y = ‘drg definition’, hue = ‘region’)
# shows the number of instances of each variable
# N.B. only specify either the x or y variable as the other variable becomes the count of that variable

Example
sns.violinplot(data=df, x='Award_Amount', y='Model Selected', palette='husl')
# sets the palette color
# other colors include ‘Paired’


Regression plots
sns.regplot(data = df, x = ‘temp’, y = ‘total_rentals’, marker = ‘+’)
# plots a linear regression model 
sns.residplot(data = df, x = ‘temp’, y = ‘total_rentals’)
# plots the residuals of a linear regression model
sns.regplot(data = df, x = ‘temp’, y = ‘total_rentals’, order = 2)
# Seabron attempts to fit a polynomial function to the data
sns.regplot(data = df, x = ‘month’, y = ‘total_rentals’, x_jitter = .1)
# regression plot of a categorical variable showing the distribution by month
sns.regplot(data = df, x = ‘month’, y = ‘total_rentals’, x_estimator = np.mean)
sns.regplot(data = df, x = ‘temp’, y = ‘total_rentals’, x_bins = 4, color = ‘g’)
# divides the temperatures into 4 bins and sets color to green

Additional arguments
fit_reg = False - disables the regression line


Matrix plots
heatmap() - requires data to be in a grid format
crosstab() - pandas function used to manipulate data into a grid format

Example 1
new_heatmap = pd.crosstab(df[‘month’], df[‘weekday’], values = df[‘total_rentals’], aggfunc = ‘mean’)
sns.heatmap(new_heatmap)

Additional arguments
annot = True - turns on annotations in the individual cells
fmt =’d’ - format argument ensures results are displayed as integars
cmap = ‘YlGnBu’ - changes color combination (yellow, green, blue)
cbar = False - the color bar is not displayed
linewidths = 0.5 - creates small spacing between each cell so that they are easier to view
center = new_heatmap.loc(9,6) - centers the heatmap colors on a specific set of coordinates

Example 2
sns.heatmap(new_heatmap.corr()) - plots the heatmap based on correlations between the columns specified in the crosstab function





4. Creating plots on data aware grids

FacetGrid()
Seaborn's FacetGrid is the foundation for building data-aware grids. A data-aware grid allows you to create a series of small plots that can be useful for understanding complex data relationships.
Analyzing data with many variables - compare multiple plots using the same scales and axes.

Two step process:
1.	Create a FacetGrid object with columns (col), rows (row) or hue (hue); and
2.	Mapping individual plots to the grid

Example
g = sns.FacetGrid(data = df, col = ‘HIGHDEG’)
g.map(sns.boxplot, ‘Tuition’)


factorplot()
Shortcut by combining faceting and mapping into one function

Example
sns.factorplot(x = ‘Tuition’, data =df, col = ‘HIGHDEG, kind = ‘box’)


lmplot()
The lmplot is used to plot scatter plots with regression lines on FacetGrid objects. The API is similar to factorplot with the difference that the default behavior of lmplot is to plot regression lines.

Example
sns.lmplot(data=df, x='UG', y='PCTPELL', col="Degree_Type", col_order = [‘Graduate’, ‘Bachelors’])
plt.show()


PairGrid()
You don’t define x and y as you want to examine all pairwise relationships between the data specified. Used to understand the best set of features to explain a relationship between variables.

Example 1
g = sns.PairGrid(data = df, vars = [‘Fair_mkt_rent’, ‘Median_Income’]
# we don’t define x and y variables as Seaborn will vary the x and y variables for each of the plots
g.map(plt.scatter)

Example 2
g = sns.PairGrid(data = df, vars = [‘Fair_mkt_rent’, ‘Median_Income’])
# we don’t define x and y variables as Seaborn will vary the x and y variables for each of the plots
g.map_diag(plt.hist)
# refers to the main diagonal from top left to bottom right
g.map_offdiag(plt.scatter)
# defines the diagonal plots as either a histogram or scatter plot


pairplot()
Works similar to FactorPlot

Example 1
g = sns.pairplot(data = df, vars = [‘Fair_mkt_rent’, ‘Median_Income’], kind = ‘reg’, diag_kind = ‘hist’)

Example 2
g = sns.pairplot(data = df.query(‘Bedrms < 3’), vars = [‘Fair_mkt_rent’, ‘Median_Income’, ‘Utility’], hue = ‘Bedrms’, palette = ‘husl’, plot_kws = {‘alpha’: 0.5})
# plots a third variable (there are now 9 plots)

Additional arguments
diag_kws = {‘alpha’: 0.5} - changes the transparency of the other diagonal plots


JointGrid
Seaborn's JointGrid combines univariate plots such as histograms, rug plots and kde plots with bivariate plots such as scatter and regression plots
Similar to the other grid plots.

Example 1
g = sns.JointGrid(data = df, x = ‘Tuition’, y = ‘ADM_RATE_ALL’)
# must define the x and y variables
g.map(sns.regplot, sns.distplot)
# the main plot is a regression plot and the two side plots (marginal plots) are distribution plots

Example 2
g = sns.JointGrid(data = df, x = ‘Tuition’, y = ‘ADM_RATE_ALL’)
g.plot_joint(sns.kdeplot)
# this is the center plot
g.plot_marginals(sns.kdeplot, shade = True)
# this is the plot on the margins
g.annotate(stas.pearsonr)
# annotates the plot with the Pearson correlation value


jointplot
Easier to use but has fewer customizations than the JointGrid

Example 1
sns.jointplot(data = df, x = ‘Tuition’, y = ‘ADM_RATE_ALL’, kind = ‘hex’)
# hex plot has been used

Additional arguments
xlim = (0, 25000) - sets the limits for the x-axis
Example 2
The jointplot is a convenience wrapper around many of the JointGrid functions. However, it is possible to overlay some of the JointGrid plots on top of the standard jointplot.

g = (sns.jointplot(x="temp",
             y="registered",
             kind='scatter',
             data=df,
             marginal_kws=dict(bins=10, rug=True))
    .plot_joint(sns.kdeplot))

plt.show()


When to use each Seaborn plots
distplot() is the best place to start to see the relationship between variables
rugplot() and kdeplot() can be useful alternatives

lmplot() is a regression plot that supports facetting. Combines features of the scatterplot, regplot and residplot. Best function for determining linear relationships between data

factorplot() - use this if you need to facet the data

pairplot() & jointplot() - useful after you have done preliminary analysis using lmplot(). Then apply the distplot function to pairplot() or jointplot()
