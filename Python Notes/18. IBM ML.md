# IBM ML  

## Week 1 intro to AI and ML  
- AI: a program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt.  
- ML: algorithms whose performance improve as they are exposed to more data over time.  
- Deep learning: subset of ML in which multilayered neural networks learn from vast amounts of data.  

### Machine learning  
- Programs learn from repeatedly seeing data, rather than being explicitly programmed by humans.  
- *Features*: use to predict the target (explanatory variable).  
- *Target*: category or value to be predicted.  
- *Label*: the value of the target for a single data point.  
- *Example*: an observation or single data point within the data.  
- Feature detection --> feed through classifier algorithm --> predict target  

### Supervised vs Unsupervised learning  
- Supervised: has a target column. The goal is to predict the target. E.g. fraud detection.   
- Unsupervised: does not have a target column. The goal is to find an underlying structure in the data. E.g. customer segmentation (find similar groupings of customers in order to be targeted).  

### Deep learning  
- Involves using models called neural networks.  
- The model determines the best representation of the original data (as opposed to classical ML where humans do this).  
- Deep neural networks with more layers.  
- TensorFlow is a library built for deep learning.  

### ML workflow    
1. Problem statement: what problem are you trying to solve?  
2. Data collection: what data do you need?  
3. Data exploration & preprocessing: how should you clean your data so your model can use it?  
4. Modelling: build a model to solve the problem  
5. Validation: did you solve the problem?  
6. Decision making and deployment: communicate to stakeholders or put into production.
